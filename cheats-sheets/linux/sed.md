# SED Cheat-Sheet
**sed** ("stream editor") is a **Linux ([[linux]])**, and Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language.

[sed 20 ecamples to remove/delete characters from a file]([The UNIX School: sed - 20 examples to remove / delete characters from a file](https://www.theunixschool.com/2014/08/sed-examples-remove-delete-chars-from-line-file.html)

>In this article of [sed series](http://www.theunixschool.com/p/awk-sed.html), we will see the examples of how to remove or delete characters from a file. The syntax of sed command replacement is:

```
sed 's/find/replace/' file
```

Let us consider a sample file as below:
```
$ cat file
Linux
Solaris
Ubuntu
Fedora
RedHat
```

**1**. **To remove a specific character**, say 'a'
```
$ sed 's/a//' file
Linux
Solris
Ubuntu
Fedor
RedHt
```
 This will remove the first occurence of 'a' in every line of the file. To remove all occurences of 'a' in every line,
 ```
 $ sed 's/a//g' file
```

**2**. **To remove 1st character in every line**:  

```
$ sed 's/^.//' file
inux
olaris
buntu
edora
edHat
```


  .(dot) tries to match a single character. The  ^ tries to match a pattern(any character) in the beginning of the line.   Another way to write the same:  

```
$ sed 's/.//' file
```

  This tells to replace a character with nothing. Since by default, sed starts from beginning, it replaces only the 1st character since 'g' is not passed.

**3. To remove last character of every line** :  

```
$ sed 's/.$//' file
Linu
Solari
Ubunt
Fedor
RedHa
```

  The $ tries to match a pattern in the end of the line.  
  
**4. To remove the 1st and last character of every line in the same command**:  

```
$ sed 's/.//;s/.$//' file
inu
olari
bunt
edor
edHa
```

   Two commands can be given together with a semi-colon separated in between.  
  
**5. To remove first character only if it is a specific character**:  

```
$ sed 's/^F//' file
Linux
Solaris
Ubuntu
edora
RedHat
```

  This removes the 1st character only if it is 'F'.  
  
**6. To remove last character only if it is a specific character**:  

```
$ sed 's/x$//' file
Linu
Solaris
Ubuntu
Fedora
RedHat
```

   This removed the last character only if it s 'x'.  
  
**7. To remove 1st 3 characters of every line**:  

```
$ sed 's/...//' file
ux
aris
ntu
ora
Hat
```
  A single dot(.) removes 1st character, 3 dots remove 1st three characters.  
  
**8. To remove 1st n characters of every line**:  

```
$ sed -r 's/.{4}//' file
x
ris
tu
ra
at
```

   .{n} -> matches any character n times, and hence the above expression matches 4 characters and deletes it.  
  
**9. To remove last n characters of every line**:  

```
$ sed -r 's/.{3}$//' file
Li
Sola
Ubu
Fed
Red
```

   
**10. To remove everything except the 1st n characters in every line**:  

```
$ sed -r 's/(.{3}).*/\1/' file
Lin
Sol
Ubu
Fed
Red
```

  .* -> matches any number of characters, and the first 3 characters matched are grouped using parantheses. In the replacement, by having \1 only the group is retained, leaving out the remaining part.  
  
**11. To remove everything except the last n characters in a file**:  

```
$ sed -r 's/.*(.{3})/\1/' file
nux
ris
ntu
ora
Hat
```

  Same as last example, except that from the end.  
  
**12. To remove multiple characters present in a file**:  

```
$ sed 's/[aoe]//g' file
Linux
Slris
Ubuntu
Fdr
RdHt
```

   To delete multiple characters, [] is used by specifying the characters to be removed. This will remove all occurences of the characters a, o and e.  
  
**13. To remove a pattern**  :  

```
$ sed 's/lari//g' file
Linux
Sos
Ubuntu
Fedora
RedHat
```

 Not just a character, even a pattern can be removed. Here, 'lari' got removed from 'Solaris'.  
  
**14. To delete only nth occurrence of a character in every line**:  

```
$ sed 's/u//2' file
Linux
Solaris
Ubunt
Fedora
RedHat
```

  By default, sed performs an activity only on the 1st occurence. If n is specifed, sed performs only on the nth occurence of the pattern. The 2nd 'u' of 'Ubuntu' got deleted.  
  
**15. To delete everything in a line followed by a character**:  

```
$ sed 's/a.*//' file
Linux
Sol
Ubuntu
Fedor
RedH
```

  
**16. To remove all digits present in every line of a file**:  

```
$ sed 's/[0-9]//g' file
```

  [0-9] stands for all characters between 0 to 9 meaning all digits, and hence all digits get removed.  
  
**17. To remove all lower case alphabets present in every line**:  

```
$ sed 's/[a-z]//g' file
L
S
U
F
RH
```

  [a-z] represents lower case alphabets range and hence all lower-case characters get removed.  
  
**18. To remove everything other than the lower case alphabets**:  

```
$ sed 's/[^a-z]//g' file
inux
olaris
buntu
edora
edat
```

   ^ inside square brackets negates the condition. Here, all characters except lower case alphabets get removed.  
  
**19. To remove all alpha-numeric characters present in every line**:  

```
$ sed 's/[a-zA-Z0-9]//g' file
```

    All alpha-numeric characters get removed.  
  
**20. To remove a character irrespective of the case**:  

```
$ sed 's/[uU]//g' file
Linx
Solaris
bnt
Fedora
RedHat
```
