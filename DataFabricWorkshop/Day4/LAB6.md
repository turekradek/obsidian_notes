    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image20.png)
    

## **Task 3: Create a notebook**

To train a model, you can create aÂ _notebook_. Notebooks provide an interactive environment in which you can write and run code (in multiple languages) asÂ _experiments_.

1. At the bottom left of the TrainModel_Lakehouse page, select theÂ **Data engineering**Â icon and switch to theÂ **Data science**Â experience.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image21.png)
    
2. In theÂ **Synapse Data Science**Â **Home**Â page, selectÂ **Notebook(Preview)**Â under current workspace ofÂ **TrainModel_FabricXX.**
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image22.png)
    
3. After a few seconds, a new notebook containing a singleÂ _cell_Â will open. Notebooks are made up of one or more cells that can containÂ **code**Â orÂ **markdown**Â (formatted text).
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image23.png)
    
4. Select the first cell (which is currently aÂ _code_Â cell), and then in the dynamic tool bar at its top-right, use theÂ **Mâ†“**Â button to convert the cell to aÂ _markdown_Â cell.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image24.png)
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image25.png)
    

When the cell changes to a markdown cell, the text it contains is rendered.

5. Use theÂ **ðŸ–‰ (Edit**) button to switch the cell to editing mode, then delete the content and enter the following text:
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `# Train a machine learning model and track with MLflow  Use the code in this notebook to train and track models.`
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image26.png)
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image27.png)
    

## **Task 4: Load data into a dataframe**

Now youâ€™re ready to run code to prepare data and train a model. To work with data, youâ€™ll useÂ _dataframes_. Dataframes in Spark are similar to Pandas dataframes in Python, and provide a common structure for working with data in rows and columns.

1. In theÂ **Lakehouse explorer**Â section, click on theÂ **Add**Â button under theÂ **Add lakehouse**Â to add a lakehouse.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image28.png)
    
2. InÂ **Add lakehouse**Â dialog box, selectÂ **Existing lakehouse**Â radio button and selectÂ **Add**.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image29.png)
    
3. InÂ **Choose the data you want to connect**Â tab, Select the your lakehouse i.eÂ **TrineModel_Lakehouse**Â and click on theÂ **Add**Â button.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image30.png)
    
4. Expand theÂ **Files**Â folder so that theÂ **churn.csv**Â file is listed next to the notebook editor.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image31.png)
    
5. Hover your mouse toÂ **churn.csv**Â file. Click on the horizontal ellipsis (â€¦) besideÂ **churn.csv**, selectÂ **Load data**Â and selectÂ **Pandas**. A new code cell containing the following code will be added to the notebook:
    
    > CodeCopy
    > 
    > import pandas as pd
    > 
    > # Load data into pandas DataFrame from "/lakehouse/default/" + "Files/churn.csv"
    > 
    > df = pd.read_csv("/lakehouse/default/" + "Files/churn.csv")
    > 
    > display(df)
    
    **Tip**: You can hide the pane containing the files on the left by using itsÂ **Â«**Â icon. Doing so will help you focus on the notebook.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image32.png)
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image33.png)
    
6. Use theÂ **â–· Run cell**Â button on the left of the cell to run it.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image34.png)
    
    **Note**: Since this is the first time youâ€™ve run any Spark code in this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the first run in the session can take a minute or so to complete. Subsequent runs will be quicker.
    
7. When the cell command has completed, review the output below the cell, which should look similar to this:
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image35.png)
    
8. The output shows the rows and columns of customer data from theÂ **churn.csv**Â file.
    

## **Task 5: Train a machine learning model**

Now that youâ€™ve loaded the data, you can use it to train a machine learning model and predict customer churn. Youâ€™ll train a model using the Scikit-Learn library and track the model with MLflow.

1. Use theÂ **+ Code**Â icon below the cell output to add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it:
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  print("Splitting data...") X, y = df[['years_with_company','total_day_calls','total_eve_calls','total_night_calls','total_intl_calls','average_call_minutes','total_customer_service_calls','age']].values, df['churn'].values  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=0)`
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image36.png)
    
2. **Run**Â the code cell you added, and note youâ€™re omitting â€˜**CustomerID**â€™ from the dataset, and splitting the data into a training and test dataset.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image37.png)
    
3. Click onÂ **+ Code**Â and copy and paste the below code and then click onÂ **Run cell**Â button.
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `import mlflow experiment_name = "experiment-churn" mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name)`
    
4. The code creates an MLflow experiment namedÂ **experiment-churn**. Your models will be tracked in this experiment.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image38.png)
    
5. Add another new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code in it, and run it:
    
    ```
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    
    with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.autolog()
    
    model = LogisticRegression(C=1/0.1, solver="liblinear").fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    mlflow.log_param("estimator", "LogisticRegression")
    ```
    
6. The code trains a classification model using Logistic Regression. Parameters, metrics, and artifacts, are automatically logged with MLflow. Additionally, youâ€™re logging a parameter calledÂ **estimator**, with the valueÂ **LogisticRegression**.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image39.png)
    
7. Click onÂ **+ Code**Â and copy and paste the below code and then click onÂ **Run cell**Â button.
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier  with mlflow.start_run():     mlflow.autolog()  ``` model = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)  mlflow.log_param("estimator", "DecisionTreeClassifier") ```  `
    
8. The code trains a classification model using Decision Tree Classifier. Parameters, metrics, and artifacts, are automatically logged with MLflow. Additionally, youâ€™re logging a parameter called estimator, with the value DecisionTreeClassifier.
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image40.png)
    

## **Task 6: Use MLflow to search and view your experiments**

When youâ€™ve trained and tracked models with MLflow, you can use the MLflow library to retrieve your experiments and its details.

1. To list all experiments, Use theÂ **+ Code**Â icon below the cell output to add the following code and use theÂ **â–· Run cell**Â button on the left of the cell to run it.
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `import mlflow experiments = mlflow.search_experiments() for exp in experiments:     print(exp.name)`
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image41.png)
    
2. To retrieve a specific experiment, you can get it by its name use theÂ **+ Code**Â icon below the cell output to add the following code and use theÂ **â–· Run cell**Â button on the left of the cell to run it.
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `experiment_name = "experiment-churn" exp = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name) print(exp)`
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image42.png)
    
3. Using an experiment name, you can retrieve all jobs of that experiment use theÂ **+ Code**Â icon below the cell output to add the following code and use theÂ **â–· Run cell**Â button on the left of the cell to run it.
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id)`
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image43.png)
    
4. To more easily compare job runs and outputs, you can configure the search to order the results. For example, the following cell orders the results byÂ **start_time**, and only shows a maximum ofÂ **2**Â results:
    
5. Use theÂ **+ Code**Â icon below the cell output to add the following code and use theÂ **â–· Run cell**Â button on the left of the cell to run it.
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)`
    
    ![BrokenImage](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab149562/instructions237215/Media08/image44.png)
    
6. Finally, you can plot the evaluation metrics of multiple models next to each other to easily compare models. Use theÂ **+ Code**Â icon below the cell output to add the following code and use theÂ **â–· Run cell**Â button on the left of the cell to run it
    
    CodeCopy
    
    `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  df_results = mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)[["metrics.training_accuracy_score", "params.estimator"]]  fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.bar(df_results["params.estimator"], df_results["metrics.training_accuracy_score"]) ax.set_xlabel("Estimator") ax.set_ylabel("Accuracy") ax.set_title("Accuracy by Estimator") for i, v in enumerate(df_results["metrics.training_accuracy_score"]):     ax.text(i, v, str(round(v, 2)), ha='center', va='bottom', fontweight='bold') plt.show()`
    
    The output should resemble the following image:
