Introduction - Lightning Labs

Welcome to the `**KodeKloud CKAD Lightning Labs**`!

  

This section has been created to give you hands-on practice in solving relatively complex questions in a short period of time.

This environment is valid for `60 minutes`, challenge yourself and try to complete all `5-6 questions` within `30 minutes`.

You can toggle between the questions but make sure that you click on `END EXAM` before the timer runs out. To pass, you need to secure `80%`.

  

**Don't worry if you can't beat the time the first time. You will still have 30 more minutes to finish and evaluate your answers. However, try to beat the time before your actual exam.**

  

Good Luck!!!
