**Creating a Pipeline**

2. Navigate to Pipelines and click on the three dots to select New pipeline.
    
4. Provide a name and description for the pipeline.
    
6. Specify the concurrency setting (default is 1).
    
8. Drag the Copy data activity from the Activities pane onto the pipeline canvas.
    
10. In the Copy data activity properties, provide the activity name and description.
    
12. Set timeout and retry settings (default is 5 minutes and 0 retries).
    
14. Configure source and sink datasets.
    
16. Skip mapping if source and sink datasets have the same structure.
    
18. Verify the pipeline and debug it to ensure data is copied correctly.
    
20. Publish the pipeline to save the changes.
    

**Managing Data**

2. Utilize Azure Storage Explorer to visualize and inspect data.
    
4. Connect to the storage account and navigate to the relevant container and file.
    
6. Download or preview the file to verify data integrity.
    
8. Delete unnecessary files to maintain data organization.
    

**Correcting Errors**

2. Identify any errors or discrepancies in data or pipeline operations.
    
4. Return to the corresponding component (dataset, activity, or pipeline) and rectify the issue.
    
6. Republish the pipeline to apply the changes and verify the corrected functionality.
    

**Key Takeaways**

2. Thoroughly validate pipelines and data before execution.
    
4. Leverage Azure Storage Explorer for data visualization and management.
    
6. Proactively address errors and discrepancies to ensure data integrity.
    
8. Regularly publish pipelines and components to maintain data consistency.
