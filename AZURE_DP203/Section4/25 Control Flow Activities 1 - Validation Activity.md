**Scenario 1: Ensuring Data Integrity with File Arrival**

**Steps:**

2. Create a validation activity within the pipeline.
    
4. Specify the desired dataset to check for the presence of a file.
    
6. Set the maximum timeout duration for waiting for the file's arrival.
    
8. Define the interval at which to check for the file's presence.
    
10. Specify the minimum file size to identify complete and error-free data.
    
12. Connect the validation activity's success output to the copy data activity.
    
14. If the file does not arrive within the specified timeout duration, the validation activity triggers an error, preventing the copy operation from proceeding.
    
16. To further enhance the handling of file arrival, connect the validation activity's failure output to other activities, such as sending an email notification to inform the responsible parties of the file's absence.
    

**Scenario 2: Handling Data Errors and Maintaining Data Quality**

**Steps:**

2. Configure the pipeline to retry the data processing operation if errors occur.
    
4. By default, the pipeline retries the operation up to three times before failing.
    
6. If the errors persist after three retries, the pipeline raises an error, preventing further processing and ensuring data integrity.
