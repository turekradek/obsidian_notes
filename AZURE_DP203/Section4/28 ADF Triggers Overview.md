**cenario 4: Scheduling the Pipeline to Run Periodically**

To ensure that the pipeline is executed consistently, it's essential to automate its execution schedule. Data Factory provides three types of triggers that facilitate automatic scheduling:

2. **Schedule Trigger:** This trigger runs the pipeline at specified times on a calendar schedule. It supports periodic intervals, specific times, and multiple pipelines attached to one trigger.
    
4. **Tumbling Window Trigger:** This trigger runs the pipeline at regular intervals, starting from a specified start date. It's useful for processing data slices based on time windows.
    
6. **Event-Based Trigger:** This trigger runs the pipeline in response to specific events, such as the creation or deletion of a file in a storage account. It's tightly coupled with a single pipeline.
    

In this scenario, the pipeline needs to be executed every day to process the updated data file. Since the file arrival time is unpredictable, a Schedule Trigger is the most suitable option.

**Implementation:**

2. **Create a Schedule Trigger:**
    
    - Navigate to the Data Factory and select 'Triggers' under the 'Manage' section.
    - Click on 'New' and choose the 'Schedule Trigger' option.
    - Set the 'Start Date' and 'Recurrence' settings. In this case, the trigger should run every day at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM UTC.
    - Specify the 'End Date' if required.
    
4. **Attach the Schedule Trigger to the Pipeline:**
    
    - Select the 'Pipeline' option and choose the pipeline that you want to schedule.
    - Click on 'Save' to create the trigger and attach it to the pipeline.
    

By following these steps, the pipeline will be automatically executed every day at the specified times, ensuring that the data is processed consistently and the Data Lake is updated with the latest information.
