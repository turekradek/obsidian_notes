The lecture notes provide a comprehensive overview of the four scenarios covered in this lesson:

2. **Validating the Data Before Copying:**
    
    - Employ the `GetMetadata` activity to extract metadata about the data file.
    - Use the `IfCondition` activity to compare the expected column count with the actual count.
    - Upon validation failure, initiate an error notification via the `WebActivity`.
    
4. **Deleting the Source File After Copying:**
    
    - Connect the `Delete Activity` to the `Copy Activity` after the verification step.
    - Ensure that the `Recursive Delete` option is unchecked.
    - Leave the `Logging Settings` unchecked.
    
6. **Scheduling the Pipeline to Run Periodically:**
    
    - Utilize a `Schedule Trigger` to automate pipeline execution.
    - Specify the `Start Date` and `Recurrence` settings based on the desired schedule.
    - Attach the `Schedule Trigger` to the relevant pipeline.
    
8. **Implementing an Event-Based Trigger:**
    
    - Create an `Event Trigger` to respond to file creation events.
    - Specify the subscription, storage account, container, and file name.
    - Enable the trigger to activate upon file creation.
    - Register the Azure Event Grid Resource Provider in the subscription.
    - Attach the `Event Trigger` to the desired pipeline.
    

The lecture also provides insights into monitoring triggers and pipeline executions within the Data Factory:

2. **Monitor Dashboard:**
    
    - Provides an overview of pipeline executions, trigger executions, and overall activity counts.
    - Enables filtering based on trigger, pipeline, and time intervals.
    
4. **Trigger Runs:**
    
    - Allows examining details of trigger executions, including success or failure status.
    - Facilitates navigating to the corresponding pipeline execution for further investigation.
    
6. **Pipeline Runs:**
    
    - Provides detailed information about pipeline executions, including activity logs and timestamps.
    - Enables identifying any errors or performance bottlenecks.
