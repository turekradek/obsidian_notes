**Scenario 2: Handling Data Inconsistencies**

Effective data processing requires ensuring that the data being processed is consistent and accurate. To address this, the pipeline can be configured to validate the data before copying it to the destination location. This is accomplished by utilizing the `GetMetadata` and `IfCondition` activities within Data Factory.

2. **GetMetadata Activity:**
    
    - Extracts metadata from the source file to determine its attributes, such as the column count.
    - Connects to the desired dataset (raw GZip file) and specifies the metadata type (column count) to retrieve.
    - Stores the extracted metadata in an output variable.
    
4. **IfCondition Activity:**
    
    - Compares the extracted metadata value (column count) with the expected value (13) using a logical expression.
    - Routes the pipeline flow based on the evaluation of the expression:
        
        - If true: Invokes the `CopyData` activity to copy the file to the destination location.
        - If false: Indicates an inconsistency and triggers an error notification using the `WebActivity` to send an email.
        
    
6. **Integration with the Validation Activity:**
    
    - Connects the `IfCondition` activity's output variable to the `CopyData` activity's input variable to ensure that the data is copied only if the column count is consistent.
    - Prevents the `IfCondition` activity from executing if the validation fails, ensuring that the inconsistent data is not processed further.
    
8. **Testing and Debugging:**
    
    - Validates the pipeline's behavior by running it in debug mode and observing the logs.
    - Identifies and corrects any errors or inconsistencies in the data before finalizing the pipeline.
    
10. **Publishing Updates:**
    
    - Publishes the modified pipeline to ensure that the changes are reflected in the Data Factory instance.
    

By implementing this approach, the pipeline can effectively handle data inconsistencies and ensure that only valid and consistent data is processed in the data lake.
