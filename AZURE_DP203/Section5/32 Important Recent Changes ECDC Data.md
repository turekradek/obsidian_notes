**Data Source and Structure:**

- Understand the four datasets available from the ECDC website: Case Distribution by Age and Sex, Case Distribution by Country and Age Group, Hospitalization Rate by Country and Age Group, and ICU Admissions Rate by Country and Age Group.
    
- Familiarize yourself with the structure of each dataset, including the data fields, data types, and data formats.
    

**Initial Pipeline Setup:**

- Grasp the concept of using a Web activity to download the data file from the ECDC website.
    
- Understand the role of the Copy activity in transferring the downloaded data file to the Azure Data Lake.
    

**Pipeline Variables and Parameters:**

- Learn how to define and utilize pipeline variables to dynamically configure pipeline behavior.
    
- Understand the purpose of parameters and how to use them to pass input data into the pipeline.
    

**Control Flow Activities:**

- Gain proficiency in using the Lookup activity to retrieve data from a previously executed activity.
    
- Familiarize yourself with the ForEach activity and its ability to iterate over a collection of data.
    

**Passing Parameters from Link Services to Datasets:**

- Understand the concept of passing parameters from link services to datasets to establish dynamic relationships between data source configurations and data ingestion tasks.

**Combining Concepts for Efficient Data Ingestion:**

- Learn how to integrate all the previously learned concepts to create a comprehensive pipeline that ingests all four ECDC datasets into the Azure Data Lake in a parallelized manner.
    
- Grasp the concept of metadata-driven configuration and parallel processing to ensure efficient data ingestion.
