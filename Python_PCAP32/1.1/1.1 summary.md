1. If you want to import a module as a whole, you can do it using the `import module_name` statement. You are allowed to import more than one module at once using a comma-separated list. For example:

`   import mod1  import mod2, mod3, mod4   `  

although the latter form is not recommended due to stylistic reasons, and it's better and prettier to express the same intention in more a verbose and explicit form, such as:

`   import mod2  import mod3  import mod4   `  

2. If a module is imported in the above manner and you want to access any of its entities, you need to prefix the entity's name using **dot notation**. For example:

`   import my_module  result = my_module.my_function(my_module.my_data)   `  

The snippet makes use of two entities coming from the `my_module` module: a function named `my_function()` and a variable named `my_data`. Both names **must be prefixed by** `my_module.` None of the imported entity names conflicts with the identical names existing in your code's namespace.

  

3. You are allowed not only to import a module as a whole, but to import only individual entities from it. In this case, the imported entities **must not be** prefixed when used. For example:

`   from module import my_function, my_data  result = my_function(my_data)   `  

The above way - despite its attractiveness - is not recommended because of the danger of causing conflicts with names derived from importing the code's namespace.

  

4. The most general form of the above statement allows you to import **all entities** offered by a module:

`   from my_module import *  result = my_function(my_data)   `  

**Note**: this import's variant is not recommended due to the same reasons as previously (the threat of a naming conflict is even more dangerous here).

5. You can change the name of the imported entity "on the fly" by using the `as` phrase of the `import`. For example:

`   from module import my_function as fun, my_data as dat  result = fun(dat)   `  

  

**Exercise 1**

You want to invoke the function `make_money()` contained in the module named `mint`. Your code begins with the following line:

`import mint`  

What is the proper form of the function's invocation?

Check  
  

**Exercise 2**

You want to invoke the function `make_money()` contained in the module named `mint`. Your code begins with the following line:

`from mint import make_money`  

What is the proper form of the function's invocation?

Check  
  

**Exercise 3**

You've written a function named `make_money` on your own. You need to import a function of the same name from the `mint` module and don't want to rename any of your previously defined names. Which variant of the `import` statement may help you with the issue?

Check  
  

**Exercise 4**

What form of the `make_money` function invocation is valid if your code starts with the following line?

`from mint import *`
