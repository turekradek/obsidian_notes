Let's summarize some important issues:

- a **module is a kind of container filled with functions** - you can pack as many functions as you want into one module and distribute it across the world;
- of course, it's generally a good idea not to mix functions with different application areas within one module (just like in a library - nobody expects scientific works to be put among comic books), so group your functions carefully and name the module containing them in a clear and intuitive way (e.g., don't give the name `arcade_games` to a module containing functions intended to partition and format hard disks)
- making many modules may cause a little mess - sooner or later you'll want to **group your modules** exactly in the same way as you've previously grouped functions - is there a more general container than a module?
- yes, there is - it's a **package**; in the world of modules, a package plays a similar role to a folder/directory in the world of files.

- [ ] EXTRA
	- [ ] iota.py
	- [ ] GOOD
		- [ ] alpha.py
		- [ ] beta.py
		- [ ] BEST
			- [ ] sigma.py
			- [ ] tau.py   ` extra.good.best.tau.funT()  `
	- [ ] UGLY
		- [ ] omega.py
		- [ ] psi.py `extra.ugly.psi.funP() `
For example:

- the location of a function named `funT()` from the tau package may be described as:  
      
    `   extra.good.best.tau.funT()       `  
    
- a function marked as:  
      
    `   extra.ugly.psi.funP()       `  
    comes from the psi module being stored in the ugly subpackage of the extra package.

## Your first package: step 4

There are two questions to answer:

- **how** do you transform such a tree (actually, a subtree) into a real Python **package** (in other words, how do you convince Python that such a tree is not just a bunch of junk files, but a set of modules)?
- **where** do you put the subtree to make it accessible to Python?

The first question has a surprising answer: **packages, like modules, may require initialization**.

The initialization of a module is done by an _unbound_ code (not a part of any function) located inside the module's file. As a package is not a file, this technique is useless for initializing packages.

You need to use a different trick instead - Python expects that there is a file with a very unique name inside the package's folder: __init__.py.

The content of the file is executed when any of the package's modules is **imported**. If you don't want any special initializations, you can leave the file empty, but you mustn't omit it.

# Your first package: step 7

We are going to access the `funI()` function from the iota module from the top of the extra package. It forces us to use qualified package names (associate this with naming folders and subfolders - the conventions are very similar).

This is how to do it:

![The main2.py file](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/6da8f46237f7f00576bc32f1c1c76292de88e991.png)  
  
`   from sys import path  path.append('..\\packages')  import extra.iota  print(extra.iota.funI())   `

main2.py

Note:

- we've modified the `path` variable to make it accessible to Python;
- the `import` doesn't point directly to the module, but specifies the fully qualified path from the top of the package;

replacing `import extra.iota` with `import iota` will cause an error.

The following variant is valid too:

![The main2.py file alternative version](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/3912ca43306d65f9cb90766865cf5add190789e0.png)  
  
`   from sys import path  path.append('..\\packages')  from extra.iota import funI  print(funI())   `

main2.py

Note the qualified name of the iota module.
# Your first package: step 8

Now let's reach all the way to the bottom of the tree - this is how to get access to the sigma and tau modules:

![The main2.py file](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/d2ae5ea44070d051fffa709cfbf79746f3cfbb13.png)  
  
`   from sys import path  path.append('..\\packages')  import extra.good.best.sigma  from extra.good.best.tau import funT  print(extra.good.best.sigma.funS())  print(funT())   `

main2.py

You can make your life easier by using aliasing:

![The main2.py file](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/2ce24012593b9bd095dcd131fba504c4b3960e1c.png)  
  
`   from sys import path  path.append('..\\packages')  import extra.good.best.sigma as sig  import extra.good.alpha as alp  print(sig.funS())  print(alp.funA())   `

main2.py

## Your first package: step 9

Let's assume that we've zipped the whole subdirectory, starting from the extra folder (including it), and let's get a file named extrapack.zip. Next, we put the file inside the packages folder.

Now we are able to use the zip file in a role of packages:

`   from sys import path  path.append('..\\packages\\extrapack.zip')  import extra.good.best.sigma as sig  import extra.good.alpha as alp  from extra.iota import funI  from extra.good.beta import funB  print(sig.funS())  print(alp.funA())  print(funI())  print(funB())   `

main2.py

If you want to conduct your own experiments with the package we've created, you can download it below. We encourage you to do so.

Now you can create modules and combine them into packages. It's time to start a completely different discussion - about errors, failures and crashes.
