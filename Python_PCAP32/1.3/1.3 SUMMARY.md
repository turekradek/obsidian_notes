1. While a **module** is designed to couple together some related entities (functions, variables, constants, etc.), a **package** is a container which enables the coupling of several related modules under one common name. Such a container can be distributed as-is (as a batch of files deployed in a directory sub-tree) or it can be packed inside a zip file.

  

2. During the very first import of the actual module, Python translates its source code into the **semi-compiled** format stored inside the **pyc** files, and deploys these files into the `__pycache__` directory located in the module's home directory.

  

3. If you want to instruct your module's user that a particular entity should be treated as **private** (i.e. not to be explicitly used outside the module) you can mark its name with either the `_` or `__` prefix. Don't forget that this is only a recommendation, not an order.

  

4. The names _shabang_, _shebang_, _hasbang_, _poundbang_, and _hashpling_ describe the digraph written as `#!`, used to instruct Unix-like OSs how the Python source file should be launched. This convention has no effect under MS Windows.

  

5. If you want convince Python that it should take into account a non-standard package's directory, its name needs to be inserted/appended into/to the import directory list stored in the `path` variable contained in the `sys` module.

  

6. A Python file named `__init__.py` is implicitly run when a package containing it is subject to import, and is used to initialize a package and/or its sub-packages (if any). The file may be empty, but must not be absent.

You want to prevent your module's user from running your code as an ordinary script. How will you achieve such an effect?

Check

`import sys if __name__ == "__main__": print "Don't do that!" sys.exit()`

**Exercise 2**

Some additional and necessary packages are stored inside the `D:\Python\Project\Modules` directory. Write a code ensuring that the directory is traversed by Python in order to find all requested modules.

Check

`import sys # note the double backslashes! sys.path.append("D:\\Python\\Project\\Modules")`

**Exercise 3**

The directory mentioned in the previous exercise contains a sub-tree of the following structure:

`abc |__ def |__ mymodule.py`  

Assuming that `D:\Python\Project\Modules` has been successfully appended to the `sys.path` list, write an import directive letting you use all the `mymodule` entities.

Check

`import abc.def.mymodule`
