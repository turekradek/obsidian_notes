# Built-in exceptions

We're going to show you a short list of the most useful exceptions. While it may sound strange to call "useful" a thing or a phenomenon which is a visible sign of failure or setback, as you know, to err is human and if anything can go wrong, it will go wrong.

Exceptions are as routine and normal as any other aspect of a programmer's life.

For each exception, we'll show you:

- its name;
- its location in the exception tree;
- a short description;
- a concise snippet of code showing the circumstances in which the exception may be raised.

There are lots of other exceptions to explore - we simply don't have the space to go through them all here.

## ArithmeticError

**Location:** BaseException ← Exception ← ArithmeticError

**Description:** an abstract exception including all exceptions caused by arithmetic operations like zero division or an argument's invalid domain

## AssertionError

**Location:** BaseException ← Exception ← AssertionError

**Description:** a concrete exception raised by the assert instruction when its argument evaluates to `False`, `None`, `0`, or an empty string

**Code:**

`   from math import tan, radians  angle = int(input('Enter integral angle in degrees: '))  # We must be sure that angle != 90 + k * 180  assert angle % 180 != 90  print(tan(radians(angle)))       `

## BaseException

**Location:** BaseException

**Description:** the most general (abstract) of all Python exceptions - all other exceptions are included in this one; it can be said that the following two except branches are equivalent: `except:` and `except BaseException:`.

## IndexError

**Location:** BaseException ← Exception ← LookupError ← IndexError

**Description:** a concrete exception raised when you try to access a non-existent sequence's element (e.g., a list's element)

**Code:**

`   # The code shows an extravagant way  # of leaving the loop.  the_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  ix = 0  do_it = True  while do_it:  try:  print(the_list[ix])  ix += 1  except IndexError:  do_it = False  print('Done')       `
