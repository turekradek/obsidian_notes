## KeyboardInterrupt

**Location:** BaseException ← KeyboardInterrupt

**Description:** a concrete exception raised when the user uses a keyboard shortcut designed to terminate a program's execution (_Ctrl-C_ in most OSs); if handling this exception doesn't lead to program termination, the program continues its execution.

Note: this exception is not derived from the Exception class. Run the program in IDLE.

**Code:**

`   # This code cannot be terminated  # by pressing Ctrl-C.  from time import sleep  seconds = 0  while True:  try:  print(seconds)  seconds += 1  sleep(1)  except KeyboardInterrupt:  print("Don't do that!")   `  

## LookupError

**Location:** BaseException ← Exception ← LookupError

**Description:** an abstract exception including all exceptions caused by errors resulting from invalid references to different collections (lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc.)

  
  

## MemoryError

**Location:** BaseException ← Exception ← MemoryError

**Description:** a concrete exception raised when an operation cannot be completed due to a lack of free memory.

**Code:**

`   # This code causes the MemoryError exception.  # Warning: executing this code may affect your OS.  # Don't run it in production environments!  string = 'x'  try:  while True:  string = string + string  print(len(string))  except MemoryError:  print('This is not funny!')   `  

## OverflowError

**Location:** BaseException ← Exception ← ArithmeticError ← OverflowError

**Description:** a concrete exception raised when an operation produces a number too big to be successfully stored

**Code:**

`   # The code prints subsequent  # values of exp(k), k = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...  from math import exp  ex = 1  try:  while True:  print(exp(ex))  ex *= 2  except OverflowError:  print('The number is too big.')       `
