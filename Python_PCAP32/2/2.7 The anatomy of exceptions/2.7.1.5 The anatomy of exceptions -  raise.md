# Exceptions: continued

The `raise` instruction raises the specified exception named `exc` as if it was raised in a normal (natural) way:

`   raise exc       `  

Note: `raise` is a keyword.

The instruction enables you to:

- **simulate raising actual exceptions** (e.g., to test your handling strategy)
- partially **handle an exception** and make another part of the code responsible for completing the handling (separation of concerns).

Look at the code in the editor. This is how you can use it in practice.

The program's output remains unchanged.

In this way, you can **test your exception handling routine** without forcing the code to do stupid things.
