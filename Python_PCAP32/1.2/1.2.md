**The platform function**

The `platform` module lets you access the underlying platform's data, i.e., hardware, operating system, and interpreter version information.

There is a function that can show you all the underlying layers in one glance, named `platform`, too. It just returns a string describing the environment; thus, its output is rather addressed to humans than to automated processing (you'll see it soon).

This is how you can invoke it:

`platform(aliased = False, terse = False)`

And now:

- `aliased` → when set to `True` (or any non-zero value) it may cause the function to present the alternative underlying layer names instead of the common ones;
- `terse` → when set to `True` (or any non-zero value) it may convince the function to present a briefer form of the result (if possible)

We ran our sample program using three different platforms - this is what we got:

**Intel x86 + Windows ® Vista (32 bit)**:

`Windows-Vista-6.0.6002-SP2 Windows-Vista-6.0.6002-SP2 Windows-Vista`

**output**

**Intel x86 + Gentoo Linux (64 bit)**:

`Linux-3.18.62-g6-x86_64-Intel-R-_Core-TM-_i3-2330M_CPU_@_2.20GHz-with-gentoo-2.3 Linux-3.18.62-g6-x86_64-Intel-R-_Core-TM-_i3-2330M_CPU_@_2.20GHz-with-gentoo-2.3 Linux-3.18.62-g6-x86_64-Intel-R-_Core-TM-_i3-2330M_CPU_@_2.20GHz-with-glibc2.3.4`

**output**

**Raspberry PI2 + Raspbian Linux (32 bit)**:

`Linux-4.4.0-1-rpi2-armv7l-with-debian-9.0 Linux-4.4.0-1-rpi2-armv7l-with-debian-9.0 Linux-4.4.0-1-rpi2-armv7l-with-glibc2.9`

**output**

You can also run the sample program in IDLE on your local machine to check what output you will have.

**The machine function**

Sometimes, you may just want to know the generic name of the processor which runs your OS together with Python and your code - a function named `machine()` will tell you that. As previously, the function returns a string.

Again, we ran the sample program on three different platforms:

**Intel x86 + Windows ® Vista (32 bit)**:

`x86`

**output**

**Intel x86 + Gentoo Linux (64 bit)**:

`x86_64`

**output**

**Raspberry PI2 + Raspbian Linux (32 bit)**:

`armv7l`

**output**

# Selected functions from the platform module: continued

**The processor function**

The `processor()` function returns a string filled with the real processor name (if possible).

Once again, we ran the sample program on three different platforms:

**Intel x86 + Windows ® Vista (32 bit)**:

`x86`

**output**

**Intel x86 + Gentoo Linux (64 bit)**:

`Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2330M CPU @ 2.20GHz`

**output**

**Raspberry PI2 + Raspbian Linux (32 bit)**:

`armv7l`

**output**

Test this on your local machine.

# Selected functions from the platform module: continued

**The system function**

A function named `system()` returns the generic OS name as a string.

Our example platforms presented themselves like this:

**Intel x86 + Windows ® Vista (32 bit)**:

`Windows`

**output**

**Intel x86 + Gentoo Linux (64 bit)**:

`Linux`

**output**

**Raspberry PI2 + Raspbian Linux (32 bit)**:

`Linux`

# Selected functions from the platform module: continued

**The version function**

The OS version is provided as a string by the `version()` function.

Run the code and check its output. This is what we got:

**Intel x86 + Windows ® Vista (32 bit)**:

`6.0.6002`

**output**

**Intel x86 + Gentoo Linux (64 bit)**:

`#1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Jul 21 22:44:37 CEST 2017`

**output**

**Raspberry PI2 + Raspbian Linux (32 bit)**:

`#1 SMP Debian 4.4.6-1+rpi14 (2016-05-05)`

**The python_implementation and the python_version_tuple functions**

If you need to know what version of Python is running your code, you can check it using a number of dedicated functions - here are two of them:

- `python_implementation()` → returns a string denoting the Python implementation (expect `CPython` here, unless you decide to use any non-canonical Python branch)
  
- `python_version_tuple()` → returns a three-element tuple filled with:
    - the **major** part of Python's version;
    - the **minor** part;
    - the **patch** level number.

Our example program produced the following output:

`CPython 3 7 7`

**sample output**

It's very likely that your version of Python will be different.
# Python Module Index

We have only covered the basics of Python modules here. Python's modules make up their own universe, in which Python itself is only a galaxy, and we would venture to say that exploring the depths of these modules can take significantly more time than getting acquainted with "pure" Python.

Moreover, the Python community all over the world creates and maintains hundreds of additional modules used in very niche applications like genetics, psychology, or even astrology.

These modules aren't (and won't be) distributed along with Python, or through official channels, which makes the Python universe broader - almost infinite.

You can read about all standard Python modules here: [https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).

Don't worry - you won't need all these modules. Many of them are very specific.

All you need to do is find the modules you want, and teach yourself how to use them. It's easy.
