# How to use pip: a simple test program

Now that _pygame_ is finally accessible, we can try to use it in a very simple test program. Let’s comment on it briefly.

- line 1: import _pygame_ and let it serve us;
- line 3: the program will run as long as the `run` variable is `True`;
- lines 4 and 5: determine the window's size;
- line 6: initialize the _pygame_ environment;
- line 7: prepare the application window and set its size;
- line 8: make an object representing the default font of size 48 points;
- line 9: make an object representing a given text – the text will be anti-aliased (`True`) and white (`255,255,255`)
- line 10: insert the text into the (currently invisible) screen buffer;
- line 11: flip the screen buffers to make the text visible;
- line 12: the _pygame_ main loop starts here;
- line 13: get a list of all pending _pygame_ events;
- lines 14 through 16: check whether the user has closed the window or clicked somewhere inside it or pressed any key;
- line 15: if yes, stop executing the code.

```PYGAME
import pygame

run = True
width = 400
height = 100
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 48)
text = font.render("Welcome to pygame", True, (255, 255, 255))
screen.blit(text, ((width - text.get_width()) // 2, (height - text.get_height()) // 2))
pygame.display.flip()
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT\
        or event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP\
        or event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            run = False

```

This is what we expect from our impressive code:

![Command prompt - python testpg.py](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/02/929c92b98466fcce4d0da90b879b105661b4b96a.png)

  
  
  

  

The `pip install` has two important additional abilities:

- it is able to **update** a locally installed package – e.g., if you want to make sure that you’re using the latest version of a particular package, you can run the following command:  
      
    `   pip install -U package_name       `  
    where `-U` means update. Note: this form of the command makes use of the `--user` option for the same purpose as presented previously;
  
- it is able to **install a user-selected version** of a package (_pip_ installs the **newest** available version by default); to achieve this goal you should use the following syntax:  
      
    `   pip install package_name==package_version       `  
    (note the double equals sign) e.g.,  
      
    `   pip install pygame==1.9.2       `
# How to use _pip_: continued

If any of the currently installed packages are **no longer needed** and you want to get rid of them, _pip_ will be useful, too. Its `uninstall` command will execute all the needed steps.

The required syntax is clear and simple:

`pip uninstall package_name`

so if you don't want _pygame_ anymore you can execute the following command:

`pip uninstall pygame`

_Pip_ will want to know if you’re sure about the choice you're making – be prepared to give the right answer.
# Use _pip_!

_Pip_'s capabilities don't end here, but the command set we've presented to you is enough to start successfully managing packages that aren't a part of the regular Python installation.

We hope we’ve encouraged you to carry out your own experiments with _pip_ and the Python package universe. PyPI invites you to dive into its extensive resources.

Some say that one of the most important programming virtues is **laziness**. Don't get us wrong – we don't want you to spend all day napping on the couch and dreaming of Python code.

A lazy programmer is a programmer who looks for existing solutions and analyzes the available code before they start to develop their own software from scratch.

This is why PyPI and _pip_ exist – use them!
