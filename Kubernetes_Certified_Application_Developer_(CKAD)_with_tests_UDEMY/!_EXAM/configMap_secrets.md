Sure, here are several ways to add a ConfigMap to a simple Kubernetes pod:

**1. Using Environment Variables**

ConfigMaps can be used to set environment variables inside a pod. Here's how you can do that:

yamlCopy code

```yamlCopycode
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: simple-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: simple-container
    image: nginx
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: my-config-map  # replace with your configmap name
```

**2. Using Individual Environment Variables**

Instead of injecting the entire ConfigMap as environment variables, you may want to select specific entries from the ConfigMap to be injected as environment variables.

yamlCopy code

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: simple-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: simple-container
    image: nginx
    env:
    - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: my-config-map   # replace with your configmap name
          key: special.how       # replace with the key you want
```

**3. Using Volumes**

ConfigMaps can also be used to populate volumes which can then be mounted inside a pod.

yamlCopy code

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: simple-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: simple-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: /etc/config   # replace with the directory you want the volume to be mounted on
  volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: my-config-map  # replace with your configmap name
```

In the volume-based approach, the ConfigMap data is stored on a volume that is attached to the pod. The container can access the ConfigMap data from the filesystem, just like it would for any other files on the filesystem.

**Note:** ConfigMaps are not suitable for sensitive data, such as passwords, SSH keys, or tokens. For these types of data, consider using [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Remember, for all these examples you need to have a ConfigMap named 'my-config-map'. If you don't have one, you can create it like this:

yamlCopy code

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config-map
data:
  special.how: very
```

Also, replace `'my-config-map'` and `'special.how'` with your actual ConfigMap name and keys respectively.

`kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=special.how=very`

The provided Pod configuration seems to be almost correct, but there is a typo in the `configMap` field under `volumes`. It is written as `congigMap`, which is incorrect.

Here's the corrected version:

yamlCopy code

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: nginx13
  name: nginx13
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx13
    resources: {}
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config13-volume
      mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
  - name: config13-volume
    configMap:  # corrected here
      name: configmap13
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

This configuration will mount a ConfigMap named `configmap13` to `/etc/config` in the pod. Make sure the ConfigMap `configmap13` exists in the same namespace as the pod, otherwise the pod will not start.

Explain differences between liveness probe and readiness probe

ChatGPT

In Kubernetes, liveness and readiness probes serve different purposes and are used to achieve different results.

**Liveness Probes:**

A liveness probe checks whether the container in which it is configured is still running. If the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will kill the container and, depending on the pod's restart policy, create a new one to replace it. The purpose of a liveness probe is to catch situations where your application is running but is in a broken state, such as a deadlock where the application is stuck and cannot proceed.

Here's an example configuration for a liveness probe:

yamlCopy code

```
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 20
```
In the above example, Kubernetes will start the liveness checks 15 seconds after the container has started (initialDelaySeconds). After that, it will perform a check every 20 seconds (periodSeconds). The check itself is a HTTP GET request to the endpoint at the /healthz path of the service running on port 8080 in the container.

**Readiness Probes:**

A readiness probe determines whether a container is ready to accept requests. If a container fails its readiness probe, Kubernetes stops sending traffic to that container until the probe succeeds.

The readiness probe can be used to control which pods are used as the backends for a service. When a pod is not ready, it gets removed from the service load balancers. Once the readiness probe is successful, it can receive traffic again.

Here's an example configuration for a readiness probe:

yamlCopy code

```
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /readiness
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

In the above example, Kubernetes will start the readiness checks 5 seconds after the container has started, and will perform a check every 10 seconds. The check itself is a HTTP GET request to the endpoint at the /readiness path of the service running on port 8080 in the container.

In summary, the liveness probe is used to know when to restart a container and the readiness probe is used to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. They can be used independently or together depending on the use case. The actual probes can be HTTP GET, TCP Socket or running a command in the container, configured according to the needs of the application.
