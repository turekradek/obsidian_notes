Pre Setup
Once you've gained access to your terminal it might be wise to spend ~1 minute to setup your environment. You could set these:

alias k=kubectl                         # will already be pre-configured

export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"    # k create deploy nginx --image=nginx $do

export now="--force --grace-period 0"   # k delete pod x $now
Vim
The following settings will already be configured in your real exam environment in ~/.vimrc. But it can never hurt to be able to type these down:

set tabstop=2
set expandtab
set shiftwidth=2
More setup suggestions are in the tips section.

# Question1 | Namespaces
Task weight: 1%

 

The DevOps team would like to get the list of all Namespaces in the cluster. Get the list and save it to /opt/course/1/namespaces.

 

Answer:
k get ns > /opt/course/1/namespaces
The content should then look like:

## /opt/course/1/namespaces
NAME           STATUS   AGE
default        Active   150m
earth          Active   76m
jupiter        Active   76m
kube-public    Active   150m
kube-system    Active   150m
mars           Active   76m
mercury        Active   76m
moon           Active   76m
neptune        Active   76m
pluto          Active   76m
saturn         Active   76m
shell-intern   Active   76m
sun            Active   76m
venus          Active   76m
 

# Question2 | Pods
Task weight: 2%

 

Create a single Pod of image httpd:2.4.41-alpine in Namespace default. The Pod should be named pod1 and the container should be named pod1-container.

Your manager would like to run a command manually on occasion to output the status of that exact Pod. Please write a command that does this into /opt/course/2/pod1-status-command.sh. The command should use kubectl.

 

Answer:
k run # help

## check the export on the very top of this document so we can use $do
k run pod1 --image=httpd:2.4.41-alpine $do > 2.yaml

vim 2.yaml
Change the container name in 2.yaml to pod1-container:

## 2.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: pod1
  name: pod1
spec:
  containers:
  - image: httpd:2.4.41-alpine
    name: pod1-container # change
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
Then run:

➜ k create -f 2.yaml
pod/pod1 created

➜ k get pod
NAME   READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
pod1   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          6s

➜ k get pod
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod1   1/1     Running   0          30s
Next create the requested command:

vim /opt/course/2/pod1-status-command.sh
The content of the command file could look like:

## /opt/course/2/pod1-status-command.sh
kubectl -n default describe pod pod1 | grep -i status:
Another solution would be using jsonpath:

## /opt/course/2/pod1-status-command.sh
kubectl -n default get pod pod1 -o jsonpath="{.status.phase}"
To test the command:

➜ sh /opt/course/2/pod1-status-command.sh
Running
 

 
# Question3 | Job
Task weight: 2%

 

Team Neptune needs a Job template located at /opt/course/3/job.yaml. This Job should run image busybox:1.31.0 and execute sleep 2 && echo done. It should be in namespace neptune, run a total of 3 times and should execute 2 runs in parallel.

Start the Job and check its history. Each pod created by the Job should have the label id: awesome-job. The job should be named neb-new-job and the container neb-new-job-container.

 

Answer:
k -n neptun create job -h

## check the export on the very top of this document so we can use $do
k -n neptune create job neb-new-job --image=busybox:1.31.0 $do > /opt/course/3/job.yaml -- sh -c "sleep 2 && echo done"

vim /opt/course/3/job.yaml
Make the required changes in the yaml:

## /opt/course/3/job.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: neb-new-job
  namespace: neptune      # add
spec:
  completions: 3          # add
  parallelism: 2          # add
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:             # add
        id: awesome-job   # add
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - sleep 2 && echo done
        image: busybox:1.31.0
        name: neb-new-job-container # update
        resources: {}
      restartPolicy: Never
status: {}
Then to create it:

k -f /opt/course/3/job.yaml create # namespace already set in yaml
Check Job and Pods, you should see two running parallel at most but three in total:

➜ k -n neptune get pod,job | grep neb-new-job
pod/neb-new-job-jhq2g              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          4s
pod/neb-new-job-vf6ts              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          4s

job.batch/neb-new-job   0/3           4s         5s


➜ k -n neptune get pod,job | grep neb-new-job
pod/neb-new-job-gm8sz              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s

➜ k -n neptune get pod,job | grep neb-new-job
pod/neb-new-job-gm8sz              0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s

pod/neb-new-job-jhq2g              0/1     Completed           0          15s
pod/neb-new-job-vf6ts              0/1     Completed           0          15s
job.batch/neb-new-job   2/3           15s        16s


➜ k -n neptune get pod,job | grep neb-new-job
pod/neb-new-job-gm8sz              0/1     Completed          0          12s
pod/neb-new-job-jhq2g              0/1     Completed          0          22s
pod/neb-new-job-vf6ts              0/1     Completed          0          22s

job.batch/neb-new-job   3/3           21s        23s
Check history:

➜ k -n neptune describe job neb-new-job
...
Events:
  Type    Reason            Age    From            Message
  ----    ------            ----   ----            -------
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  2m52s  job-controller  Created pod: neb-new-job-jhq2g
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  2m52s  job-controller  Created pod: neb-new-job-vf6ts
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  2m42s  job-controller  Created pod: neb-new-job-gm8sz
At the age column we can see that two pods run parallel and the third one after that. Just as it was required in the task.

 

 

# Question4 | Helm Management
Task weight: 5%

 

Team Mercury asked you to perform some operations using Helm, all in Namespace mercury:

Delete release internal-issue-report-apiv1
Upgrade release internal-issue-report-apiv2 to any newer version of chart bitnami/nginx available
Install a new release internal-issue-report-apache of chart bitnami/apache. The Deployment should have two replicas, set these via Helm-values during install
There seems to be a broken release, stuck in pending-install state. Find it and delete it
 

Answer:
Helm Chart: Kubernetes YAML template-files combined into a single package, Values allow customisation

Helm Release: Installed instance of a Chart

Helm Values: Allow to customise the YAML template-files in a Chart when creating a Release

 

1.

First we should delete the required release:

➜ helm -n mercury ls
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apiv1     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-apiv2     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-app       mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1  

➜ helm -n mercury uninstall internal-issue-report-apiv1
release "internal-issue-report-apiv1" uninstalled

➜ helm -n mercury ls
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apiv2     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-app       mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1  
 

2.

Next we need to upgrade a release, for this we could first list the charts of the repo:

➜ helm repo list
NAME    URL                               
bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

➜ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "bitnami" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈

➜ helm search repo nginx
NAME                  CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION          
bitnami/nginx         9.5.2           1.21.1          Chart for the nginx server             ...
Here we see that a newer chart version 9.5.2 is available. But the task only requires us to upgrade to any newer chart version available, so we can simply run:

➜ helm -n mercury upgrade internal-issue-report-apiv2 bitnami/nginx
Release "internal-issue-report-apiv2" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: internal-issue-report-apiv2
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Aug 31 17:40:42 2021
NAMESPACE: mercury
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
...

➜ helm -n mercury ls
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apiv2     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.2     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-app       mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1 
Looking good!

INFO: Also check out helm rollback for undoing a helm rollout/upgrade

 

3.

Now we're asked to install a new release, with a customised values setting. For this we first list all possible value settings for the chart, we can do this via:

helm show values bitnami/apache # will show a long list of all possible value-settings

helm show values bitnami/apache | yq e # parse yaml and show with colors
Huge list, if we search in it we should find the setting replicaCount: 1 on top level. This means we can run:

➜ helm -n mercury install internal-issue-report-apache bitnami/apache --set replicaCount=2
NAME: internal-issue-report-apache
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Aug 31 17:57:23 2021
NAMESPACE: mercury
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
...
If we would also need to set a value on a deeper level, for example image.debug, we could run:

helm -n mercury install internal-issue-report-apache bitnami/apache \
  --set replicaCount=2 
  --set image.debug=true
Install done, let's verify what we did:

➜ helm -n mercury ls
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apache    mercury       deployed        apache-8.6.3    2.4.48
...

➜ k -n mercury get deploy internal-issue-report-apache
NAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
internal-issue-report-apache   2/2     2            2           96s
We see a healthy deployment with two replicas!

 

4.

By default releases in pending-upgrade state aren't listed, but we can show all to find and delete the broken release:

➜ helm -n mercury ls -a
NAME                            NAMESPACE     STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
internal-issue-report-apache    mercury       deployed        apache-8.6.3    2.4.48     
internal-issue-report-apiv2     mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.2     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-app       mercury       deployed        nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1     
internal-issue-report-daniel    mercury       pending-install nginx-9.5.0     1.21.1 

➜ helm -n mercury uninstall internal-issue-report-daniel
release "internal-issue-report-daniel" uninstalled
Thank you Helm for making our lifes easier! (Till something breaks)

 

 

# Question5 | ServiceAccount, Secret
Task weight: 3%

 

Team Neptune has its own ServiceAccount named neptune-sa-v2 in Namespace neptune. A coworker needs the token from the Secret that belongs to that ServiceAccount. Write the base64 decoded token to file /opt/course/5/token.

 

Answer:
Since K8s 1.24, Secrets won't be created automatically for ServiceAccounts any longer. But it's still possible to create a Secret manually and attach it to a ServiceAccount by setting the correct annotation on the Secret. This was done for this task.

k -n neptune get sa # get overview
k -n neptune get secrets # shows all secrets of namespace
k -n neptune get secrets -oyaml | grep annotations -A 1 # shows secrets with first annotation
If a Secret belongs to a ServiceAccont, it'll have the annotation kubernetes.io/service-account.name. Here the Secret we're looking for is neptune-secret-1.

➜ k -n neptune get secret neptune-secret-1 -o yaml

# Question6 | ReadinessProbe
Task weight: 7%

 

Create a single Pod named pod6 in Namespace default of image busybox:1.31.0. The Pod should have a readiness-probe executing cat /tmp/ready. It should initially wait 5 and periodically wait 10 seconds. This will set the container ready only if the file /tmp/ready exists.

The Pod should run the command touch /tmp/ready && sleep 1d, which will create the necessary file to be ready and then idles. Create the Pod and confirm it starts.

 

Answer:
k run pod6 --image=busybox:1.31.0 $do --command -- sh -c "touch /tmp/ready && sleep 1d" > 6.yaml

vim 6.yaml
Search for a readiness-probe example on https://kubernetes.io/docs, then copy and alter the relevant section for the task:

status: {}
Then:

k -f 6.yaml create
Running k get pod6 we should see the job being created and completed:

➜ k get pod pod6
NAME   READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
pod6   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          2s

➜ k get pod pod6
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod6   0/1     Running   0          7s

➜ k get pod pod6
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod6   1/1     Running   0          15s
We see that the Pod is finally ready.

 

 

# Question7 | Pods, Namespaces
Task weight: 4%

 

The board of Team Neptune decided to take over control of one e-commerce webserver from Team Saturn. The administrator who once setup this webserver is not part of the organisation any longer. All information you could get was that the e-commerce system is called my-happy-shop.

Search for the correct Pod in Namespace saturn and move it to Namespace neptune. It doesn't matter if you shut it down and spin it up again, it probably hasn't any customers anyways.

 

Answer:
Let's see all those Pods:

➜ k -n saturn get pod
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
webserver-sat-001   1/1     Running   0          111m
webserver-sat-002   1/1     Running   0          111m
webserver-sat-003   1/1     Running   0          111m
webserver-sat-004   1/1     Running   0          111m
webserver-sat-005   1/1     Running   0          111m
webserver-sat-006   1/1     Running   0          111m
The Pod names don't reveal any information. We assume the Pod we are searching has a label or annotation with the name my-happy-shop, so we search for it:

k -n saturn describe pod # describe all pods, then manually look for it

## or do some filtering like this
k -n saturn get pod -o yaml | grep my-happy-shop -A10
We see the webserver we're looking for is webserver-sat-003

k -n saturn get pod webserver-sat-003 -o yaml > 7_webserver-sat-003.yaml # export
vim 7_webserver-sat-003.yaml
Change the Namespace to neptune, also remove the status: section, the token volume, the token volumeMount and the nodeName, else the new Pod won't start. The final file could look as clean like this:

## 7_webserver-sat-003.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    description: this is the server for the E-Commerce System my-happy-shop
  labels:
    id: webserver-sat-003
  name: webserver-sat-003
  namespace: neptune # new namespace here
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:1.16.1-alpine
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: webserver-sat
  restartPolicy: Always
Then we execute:

k -n neptune create -f 7_webserver-sat-003.yaml
➜ k -n neptune get pod | grep webserver
webserver-sat-003               1/1     Running            0          22s
It seems the server is running in Namespace neptune, so we can do:

k -n saturn delete pod webserver-sat-003 --force --grace-period=0
Let's confirm only one is running:

➜ k get pod -A | grep webserver-sat-003
neptune        webserver-sat-003         1/1     Running            0          6s
This should list only one pod called webserver-sat-003 in Namespace neptune, status running.

 

 

# Question8 | Deployment, Rollouts
Task weight: 4%

 

There is an existing Deployment named api-new-c32 in Namespace neptune. A developer did make an update to the Deployment but the updated version never came online. Check the Deployment history and find a revision that works, then rollback to it. Could you tell Team Neptune what the error was so it doesn't happen again?

 

Answer:
k -n neptune get deploy # overview
k -n neptune rollout -h
k -n neptune rollout history -h
➜ k -n neptune rollout history deploy api-new-c32
deployment.extensions/api-new-c32 
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         none
2         kubectl edit deployment api-new-c32 --namespace=neptune
3         kubectl edit deployment api-new-c32 --namespace=neptune
4         kubectl edit deployment api-new-c32 --namespace=neptune
5         kubectl edit deployment api-new-c32 --namespace=neptune
We see 5 revisions, let's check Pod and Deployment status:

➜ k -n neptune get deploy,pod | grep api-new-c32
deployment.extensions/api-new-c32    3/3     1            3           141m

pod/api-new-c32-65d998785d-jtmqq    1/1     Running            0          141m
pod/api-new-c32-686d6f6b65-mj2fp    1/1     Running            0          141m
pod/api-new-c32-6dd45bdb68-2p462    1/1     Running            0          141m
pod/api-new-c32-7d64747c87-zh648    0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          141m
Let's check the pod for errors:

➜ k -n neptune describe pod api-new-c32-7d64747c87-zh648 | grep -i error
  ...  Error: ImagePullBackOff
➜ k -n neptune describe pod api-new-c32-7d64747c87-zh648 | grep -i image
    Image:          ngnix:1.16.3
    Image ID:
      Reason:       ImagePullBackOff
  Warning  Failed  4m28s (x616 over 144m)  kubelet, gke-s3ef67020-28c5-45f7--default-pool-248abd4f-s010  Error: ImagePullBackOff
Someone seems to have added a new image with a spelling mistake in the name ngnix:1.16.3, that's the reason we can tell Team Neptune!

Now let's revert to the previous version:

k -n neptune rollout undo deploy api-new-c32
Does this one work?

➜ k -n neptune get deploy api-new-c32
NAME          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
api-new-c32   3/3     3            3           146m
Yes! All up-to-date and available.

Also a fast way to get an overview of the ReplicaSets of a Deployment and their images could be done with:

k -n neptune get rs -o wide | grep api-new-c32
 

 

# Question9 | Pod -> Deployment
Task weight: 5%

 

In Namespace pluto there is single Pod named holy-api. It has been working okay for a while now but Team Pluto needs it to be more reliable. Convert the Pod into a Deployment with 3 replicas and name holy-api. The raw Pod template file is available at /opt/course/9/holy-api-pod.yaml.

In addition, the new Deployment should set allowPrivilegeEscalation: false and privileged: false for the security context on container level.

Please create the Deployment and save its yaml under /opt/course/9/holy-api-deployment.yaml.

 

Answer
There are multiple ways to do this, one is to copy an Deployment example from https://kubernetes.io/docs and then merge it with the existing Pod yaml. That's what we will do now:

cp /opt/course/9/holy-api-pod.yaml /opt/course/9/holy-api-deployment.yaml # make a copy!

vim /opt/course/9/holy-api-deployment.yaml
Now copy/use a Deployment example yaml and put the Pod's metadata: and spec: into the Deployment's template: section:

## /opt/course/9/holy-api-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: holy-api        # name stays the same
  namespace: pluto      # important
spec:
  replicas: 3           # 3 replicas
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: holy-api      # set the correct selector
  template:
    # => from here down its the same as the pods metadata: and spec: sections
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: holy-api
      name: holy-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: CACHE_KEY_1
          value: b&MTCi0=[T66RXm!jO@
        - name: CACHE_KEY_2
          value: PCAILGej5Ld@Q%{Q1=#
        - name: CACHE_KEY_3
          value: 2qz-]2OJlWDSTn_;RFQ
        image: nginx:1.17.3-alpine
        name: holy-api-container
        securityContext:                   # add
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false  # add
          privileged: false                # add
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /cache1
          name: cache-volume1
        - mountPath: /cache2
          name: cache-volume2
        - mountPath: /cache3
          name: cache-volume3
      volumes:
      - emptyDir: {}
        name: cache-volume1
      - emptyDir: {}
        name: cache-volume2
      - emptyDir: {}
        name: cache-volume3
To indent multiple lines using vim you should set the shiftwidth using :set shiftwidth=2. Then mark multiple lines using Shift v and the up/down keys.

To then indent the marked lines press  or  and to repeat the action press .

Next create the new Deployment:

k -f /opt/course/9/holy-api-deployment.yaml create
and confirm it's running:

➜ k -n pluto get pod | grep holy
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
holy-api                    1/1     Running   0          19m
holy-api-5dbfdb4569-8qr5x   1/1     Running   0          30s
holy-api-5dbfdb4569-b5clh   1/1     Running   0          30s
holy-api-5dbfdb4569-rj2gz   1/1     Running   0          30s
Finally delete the single Pod:

k -n pluto delete pod holy-api --force --grace-period=0
➜ k -n pluto get pod,deployment | grep holy
pod/holy-api-5dbfdb4569-8qr5x   1/1     Running   0          2m4s
pod/holy-api-5dbfdb4569-b5clh   1/1     Running   0          2m4s
pod/holy-api-5dbfdb4569-rj2gz   1/1     Running   0          2m4s

deployment.extensions/holy-api   3/3     3            3           2m4s
 

 

# Question10 | Service, Logs
Task weight: 4%

 

Team Pluto needs a new cluster internal Service. Create a ClusterIP Service named project-plt-6cc-svc in Namespace pluto. This Service should expose a single Pod named project-plt-6cc-api of image nginx:1.17.3-alpine, create that Pod as well. The Pod should be identified by label project: plt-6cc-api. The Service should use tcp port redirection of 3333:80.

Finally use for example curl from a temporary nginx:alpine Pod to get the response from the Service. Write the response into /opt/course/10/service_test.html. Also check if the logs of Pod project-plt-6cc-api show the request and write those into /opt/course/10/service_test.log.

 

Answer
k -n pluto run project-plt-6cc-api --image=nginx:1.17.3-alpine --labels project=plt-6cc-api
This will create the requested Pod. In yaml it would look like this:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    project: plt-6cc-api
  name: project-plt-6cc-api
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:1.17.3-alpine
    name: project-plt-6cc-api
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
Next we create the service:

k -n pluto expose pod -h # help

k -n pluto expose pod project-plt-6cc-api --name project-plt-6cc-svc --port 3333 --target-port 80
Expose will create a yaml where everything is already set for our case and no need to change anything:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    project: plt-6cc-api
  name: project-plt-6cc-svc   # good
  namespace: pluto            # great
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3333                # awesome
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80            # nice
  selector:
    project: plt-6cc-api      # beautiful
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
We could also use create service but then we would need to change the yaml afterwards:

k -n pluto create service -h # help
k -n pluto create service clusterip -h #help
k -n pluto create service clusterip project-plt-6cc-svc --tcp 3333:80 $do
## now we would need to set the correct selector labels
Check the Service is running:

➜ k -n pluto get pod,svc | grep 6cc
pod/project-plt-6cc-api         1/1     Running   0          9m42s

service/project-plt-6cc-svc   ClusterIP   10.31.241.234   none        3333/TCP   2m24s
Does the Service has one Endpoint?

➜ k -n pluto describe svc project-plt-6cc-svc
Name:              project-plt-6cc-svc
Namespace:         pluto
Labels:            project=plt-6cc-api
Annotations:       none
Selector:          project=plt-6cc-api
Type:              ClusterIP
IP:                10.3.244.240
Port:              unset  3333/TCP
TargetPort:        80/TCP
Endpoints:         10.28.2.32:80 
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            none
Or even shorter:

➜ k -n pluto get ep
NAME                  ENDPOINTS       AGE
project-plt-6cc-svc   10.28.2.32:80   84m
Yes, endpoint there! Finally we check the connection using a temporary Pod:

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm --image=nginx:alpine -i -- curl http://project-plt-6cc-svc.pluto:3333
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   612  100   612    0     0  32210      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 32210
```
	<!DOCTYPE html>

	<body>
	<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
```
...
Great! Notice that we use the Kubernetes Namespace dns resolving (project-plt-6cc-svc.pluto) here. We could only use the Service name if we would also spin up the temporary Pod in Namespace pluto .

And now really finally copy or pipe the html content into /opt/course/10/service_test.html.

## /opt/course/10/service_test.html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>

        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
```
...
Also the requested logs:

k -n pluto logs project-plt-6cc-api > /opt/course/10/service_test.log
## /opt/course/10/service_test.log

# Question11 | Working with Containers
Task weight: 7%

 

During the last monthly meeting you mentioned your strong expertise in container technology. Now the Build&Release team of department Sun is in need of your insight knowledge. There are files to build a container image located at /opt/course/11/image. The container will run a Golang application which outputs information to stdout. You're asked to perform the following tasks:

 

NOTE: Make sure to run all commands as user k8s, for docker use sudo docker

 

Change the Dockerfile. The value of the environment variable SUN_CIPHER_ID should be set to the hardcoded value 5b9c1065-e39d-4a43-a04a-e59bcea3e03f
Build the image using Docker, named registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher, tagged as latest and v1-docker, push these to the registry
Build the image using Podman, named registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher, tagged as v1-podman, push it to the registry
Run a container using Podman, which keeps running in the background, named sun-cipher using image registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman. Run the container from k8s@terminal and not root@terminal
Write the logs your container sun-cipher produced into /opt/course/11/logs. Then write a list of all running Podman containers into /opt/course/11/containers
 

Answer
Dockerfile: list of commands from which an Image can be build

Image: binary file which includes all data/requirements to be run as a Container

Container: running instance of an Image

Registry: place where we can push/pull Images to/from

 

1.

First we need to change the Dockerfile to:

## build container stage 1
FROM docker.io/library/golang:1.15.15-alpine3.14
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o bin/app .

## app container stage 2
FROM docker.io/library/alpine:3.12.4
COPY --from=0 /src/bin/app app
## CHANGE NEXT LINE
ENV SUN_CIPHER_ID=5b9c1065-e39d-4a43-a04a-e59bcea3e03f
CMD ["./app"]
 
sudo docker build -t registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:latest -t registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-docker .
2.

Then we build the image using Docker:

➜ cd /opt/course/11/image

➜ sudo docker build -t registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:latest -t registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-docker .
...
Successfully built 409fde3c5bf9
Successfully tagged registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:latest
Successfully tagged registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-docker

➜ sudo docker image ls
REPOSITORY                           TAG         IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher   latest      409fde3c5bf9   24 seconds ago       7.76MB
registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher   v1-docker   409fde3c5bf9   24 seconds ago       7.76MB
...

➜ sudo docker push registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:latest
The push refers to repository [registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher]
c947fb5eba52: Pushed 
33e8713114f8: Pushed 
latest: digest: sha256:d216b4136a5b232b738698e826e7d12fccba9921d163b63777be23572250f23d size: 739

➜ sudo docker push registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-docker
The push refers to repository [registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher]

There we go, built and pushed.

 

3.

Next we build the image using Podman. Here it's only required to create one tag. The usage of Podman is very similar (for most cases even identical) to Docker:

➜ cd /opt/course/11/image

➜ podman build -t registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman .
...
--> 38adc53bd92
Successfully tagged registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman
38adc53bd92881d91981c4b537f4f1b64f8de1de1b32eacc8479883170cee537

➜ podman image ls
REPOSITORY                          TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher  v1-podman   38adc53bd928  2 minutes ago  8.03 MB
...

➜ podman push registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob 4d0d60db9eb6 done  
Copying blob 33e8713114f8 done  
Copying config bfa1a225f8 done  
Writing manifest to image destination
Storing signatures
Built and pushed using Podman.

 

4.

We'll create a container from the perviously created image, using Podman, which keeps running in the background:

➜ podman run -d --name sun-cipher registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman
f8199cba792f9fd2d1bd4decc9b7a9c0acfb975d95eda35f5f583c9efbf95589

 

5.

Finally we need to collect some information into files:

➜ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                         COMMAND     ...       
f8199cba792f  registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman  ./app       ...

➜ podman ps > /opt/course/11/containers

➜ podman logs sun-cipher

# Question12 | Storage, PV, PVC, Pod volume
Task weight: 8%

 

Create a new PersistentVolume named earth-project-earthflower-pv. It should have a capacity of 2Gi, accessMode ReadWriteOnce, hostPath /Volumes/Data and no storageClassName defined.

Next create a new PersistentVolumeClaim in Namespace earth named earth-project-earthflower-pvc . It should request 2Gi storage, accessMode ReadWriteOnce and should not define a storageClassName. The PVC should bound to the PV correctly.

Finally create a new Deployment project-earthflower in Namespace earth which mounts that volume at /tmp/project-data. The Pods of that Deployment should be of image httpd:2.4.41-alpine.

 

Answer
vim 12_pv.yaml
Find an example from https://kubernetes.io/docs and alter it:

## 12_pv.yaml
kind: PersistentVolume
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: earth-project-earthflower-pv
spec:
 capacity:
  storage: 2Gi
 accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
 hostPath:
  path: "/Volumes/Data"
Then create it:

k -f 12_pv.yaml create
Next the PersistentVolumeClaim:

vim 12_pvc.yaml
Find an example from https://kubernetes.io/docs and alter it:

## 12_pvc.yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: earth-project-earthflower-pvc
  namespace: earth
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
     storage: 2Gi
Then create:

k -f 12_pvc.yaml create
And check that both have the status Bound:

➜ k -n earth get pv,pvc
NAME                                 CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   ...  STATUS   CLAIM 
persistentvolume/...earthflower-pv   2Gi        RWO            ...  Bound    ...er-pvc

NAME                                       STATUS   VOLUME                         CAPACITY
persistentvolumeclaim/...earthflower-pvc   Bound    earth-project-earthflower-pv   2Gi
Next we create a Deployment and mount that volume:

k -n earth create deploy project-earthflower --image=httpd:2.4.41-alpine $do > 12_dep.yaml

vim 12_dep.yaml
Alter the yaml to mount the volume:

## 12_dep.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: project-earthflower
  name: project-earthflower
  namespace: earth
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: project-earthflower
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: project-earthflower
    spec:
      volumes:                                      # add
      - name: data                                  # add
        persistentVolumeClaim:                      # add
          claimName: earth-project-earthflower-pvc  # add
      containers:
      - image: httpd:2.4.41-alpine
        name: container
        volumeMounts:                               # add
        - name: data                                # add
          mountPath: /tmp/project-data              # add
k -f 12_dep.yaml create
We can confirm it's mounting correctly:

➜ k -n earth describe pod project-earthflower-d6887f7c5-pn5wv | grep -A2 Mounts:   
    Mounts:
      /tmp/project-data from data (rw) # there it is
      /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from default-token-n2sjj (ro)
 

 

# Question13 | Storage, StorageClass, PVC
Task weight: 6%

 

Team Moonpie, which has the Namespace moon, needs more storage. Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim named moon-pvc-126 in that namespace. This claim should use a new StorageClass moon-retain with the provisioner set to moon-retainer and the reclaimPolicy set to Retain. The claim should request storage of 3Gi, an accessMode of ReadWriteOnce and should use the new StorageClass.

The provisioner moon-retainer will be created by another team, so it's expected that the PVC will not boot yet. Confirm this by writing the log message from the PVC into file /opt/course/13/pvc-126-reason.

 

Answer
vim 13_sc.yaml
Head to https://kubernetes.io/docs, search for "storageclass" and alter the example code to this:

## 13_sc.yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: moon-retain
provisioner: moon-retainer
reclaimPolicy: Retain
k create -f 13_sc.yaml
Now the same for the PersistentVolumeClaim, head to the docs, copy an example and transform it into:

vim 13_pvc.yaml
## 13_pvc.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: moon-pvc-126            # name as requested
  namespace: moon               # important
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce             # RWO
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi              # size
  storageClassName: moon-retain # uses our new storage class
k -f 13_pvc.yaml create
Next we check the status of the PVC :

➜ k -n moon get pvc
NAME           STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
moon-pvc-126   Pending                                      moon-retain    2m57s
➜ k -n moon describe pvc moon-pvc-126
Name:          moon-pvc-126
...
Status:        Pending
...
Events:
...
waiting for a volume to be created, either by external provisioner "moon-retainer" or manually created by system administrator
This confirms that the PVC waits for the provisioner moon-retainer to be created. Finally we copy or write the event message into the requested location:

## /opt/course/13/pvc-126-reason
waiting for a volume to be created, either by external provisioner "moon-retainer" or manually created by system administrator
 

 

# Question14 | Secret, Secret-Volume, Secret-Env
Task weight: 4%

 

You need to make changes on an existing Pod in Namespace moon called secret-handler. Create a new Secret secret1 which contains user=test and pass=pwd. The Secret's content should be available in Pod secret-handler as environment variables SECRET1_USER and SECRET1_PASS. The yaml for Pod secret-handler is available at /opt/course/14/secret-handler.yaml.

There is existing yaml for another Secret at /opt/course/14/secret2.yaml, create this Secret and mount it inside the same Pod at /tmp/secret2. Your changes should be saved under /opt/course/14/secret-handler-new.yaml. Both Secrets should only be available in Namespace moon.

 

Answer
k -n moon get pod # show pods
k -n moon create secret -h # help
k -n moon create secret generic -h # help
k -n moon create secret generic secret1 --from-literal user=test --from-literal pass=pwd
The last command would generate this yaml:

apiVersion: v1
data:
  pass: cHdk
  user: dGVzdA==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: secret1
  namespace: moon
Next we create the second Secret from the given location, making sure it'll be created in Namespace moon:

k -n moon -f /opt/course/14/secret2.yaml create
➜ k -n moon get secret
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-rvzcf   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      66m
secret1               Opaque                                2      4m3s
secret2               Opaque                                1      8s
We will now edit the Pod yaml:

cp /opt/course/14/secret-handler.yaml /opt/course/14/secret-handler-new.yaml
vim /opt/course/14/secret-handler-new.yaml
Add the following to the yaml:

## /opt/course/14/secret-handler-new.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    id: secret-handler
    uuid: 1428721e-8d1c-4c09-b5d6-afd79200c56a

  - name: secret2-volume              # add
    secret:                           # add

      value: ">8$kH#kj..i8}HImQd{"
    - name: SECRET_KEY_2
      value: "IO=a4L/XkRdvN8jM=Y+"
    - name: SECRET_KEY_3
      value: "-7PA0_Z]>{pwa43r)__"
    - name: SECRET1_USER              # add
      valueFrom:                      # add
        secretKeyRef:                 # add
          name: secret1               # add
          key: user                   # add
    - name: SECRET1_PASS              # add
      valueFrom:                      # add
        secretKeyRef:                 # add
          name: secret1               # add
          key: pass                   # add
There is also the possibility to import all keys from a Secret as env variables at once, though the env variable names will then be the same as in the Secret, which doesn't work for the requirements here:

  containers:
  - name: secret-handler
...
    envFrom:
    - secretRef:        # also works for configMapRef
        name: secret1
Then we apply the changes:

k -f /opt/course/14/secret-handler.yaml delete --force --grace-period=0
k -f /opt/course/14/secret-handler-new.yaml create
Instead of running delete and create we can also use recreate:

k -f /opt/course/14/secret-handler-new.yaml replace --force --grace-period=0
It was not requested directly, but you should always confirm it's working:

➜ k -n moon exec secret-handler -- env | grep SECRET1
SECRET1_USER=test
SECRET1_PASS=pwd

➜ k -n moon exec secret-handler -- find /tmp/secret2 
/tmp/secret2
/tmp/secret2/..data
/tmp/secret2/key
/tmp/secret2/..2019_09_11_09_03_08.147048594
/tmp/secret2/..2019_09_11_09_03_08.147048594/key

➜ k -n moon exec secret-handler -- cat /tmp/secret2/key
12345678
 

 

# Question15 | ConfigMap, Configmap-Volume
Task weight: 5%

 

Team Moonpie has a nginx server Deployment called web-moon in Namespace moon. Someone started configuring it but it was never completed. To complete please create a ConfigMap called configmap-web-moon-html containing the content of file /opt/course/15/web-moon.html under the data key-name index.html.

The Deployment web-moon is already configured to work with this ConfigMap and serve its content. Test the nginx configuration for example using curl from a temporary nginx:alpine Pod.

 

Answer
Let's check the existing Pods:

➜ k -n moon get pod
NAME                        READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
secret-handler              1/1     Running             0          55m

web-moon-847496c686-tj7ct   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          33s
➜ k -n moon describe pod web-moon-847496c686-2rzj4
...
Warning  FailedMount  31s (x7 over 63s)  kubelet, gke-test-default-pool-ce83a51a-p6s4  MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "html-volume" : configmaps "configmap-web-moon-html" not found
Good so far, now let's create the missing ConfigMap:

k -n moon create configmap -h # help

k -n moon create configmap configmap-web-moon-html --from-file=index.html=/opt/course/15/web-moon.html # important to set the index.html key
This should create a ConfigMap with yaml like:

apiVersion: v1
data:
  index.html: |     # notice the key index.html, this will be the filename when mounted
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Web Moon Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    This is some great content.
    </body>
    </html>
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: configmap-web-moon-html
  namespace: moon
After waiting a bit or deleting/recreating (k -n moon rollout restart deploy web-moon) the Pods we should see:

➜ k -n moon get pod
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
secret-handler              1/1     Running   0          59m
web-moon-847496c686-2rzj4   1/1     Running   0          4m28s
web-moon-847496c686-9nwwj   1/1     Running   0          4m28s
web-moon-847496c686-cxdbx   1/1     Running   0          4m28s
web-moon-847496c686-hvqlw   1/1     Running   0          4m28s
web-moon-847496c686-tj7ct   1/1     Running   0          4m28s
Looking much better. Finally we check if the nginx returns the correct content:

k -n moon get pod -o wide # get pod cluster IPs
Then use one IP to test the configuration:

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl 10.44.0.78
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   161  100   161    0     0  80500      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  157k
!DOCTYPE html
html lang="en"
head
    meta charset="UTF-8"
    titleWeb Moon Webpage/title
/head
body
This is some great content.
/body
For debugging or further checks we could find out more about the Pods volume mounts:

➜ k -n moon describe pod web-moon-c77655cc-dc8v4 | grep -A2 Mounts:
    Mounts:
      /usr/share/nginx/html from html-volume (rw)
      /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from default-token-rvzcf (ro)
And check the mounted folder content:

➜ k -n moon exec web-moon-c77655cc-dc8v4 find /usr/share/nginx/html
/usr/share/nginx/html
/usr/share/nginx/html/..2019_09_11_10_05_56.336284411
/usr/share/nginx/html/..2019_09_11_10_05_56.336284411/index.html
/usr/share/nginx/html/..data
/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
Here it was important that the file will have the name index.html and not the original one web-moon.html which is controlled through the ConfigMap data key.



# Question16 | Logging sidecar
Task weight: 6%

 

The Tech Lead of Mercury2D decided it's time for more logging, to finally fight all these missing data incidents. There is an existing container named cleaner-con in Deployment cleaner in Namespace mercury. This container mounts a volume and writes logs into a file called cleaner.log.

The yaml for the existing Deployment is available at /opt/course/16/cleaner.yaml. Persist your changes at /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml but also make sure the Deployment is running.

Create a sidecar container named logger-con, image busybox:1.31.0 , which mounts the same volume and writes the content of cleaner.log to stdout, you can use the tail -f command for this. This way it can be picked up by kubectl logs.

Check if the logs of the new container reveal something about the missing data incidents.

 

Answer
cp /opt/course/16/cleaner.yaml /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml
vim /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml
Add a sidecar container which outputs the log file to stdout:

# /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: cleaner
  namespace: mercury
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: cleaner
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: cleaner
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: logs
        emptyDir: {}
      initContainers:
      - name: init
        image: bash:5.0.11
        command: ['bash', '-c', 'echo init > /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: logs
          mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
      containers:
      - name: cleaner-con
        image: bash:5.0.11
        args: ['bash', '-c', 'while true; do echo `date`: "remove random file" >> /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log; sleep 1; done']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: logs
          mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
      - name: logger-con                                                # add
        image: busybox:1.31.0                                           # add
        command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log"]   # add
        volumeMounts:                                                   # add
        - name: logs                                                    # add
          mountPath: /var/log/cleaner                                   # add
Then apply the changes and check the logs of the sidecar:

k -f /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml apply
This will cause a deployment rollout of which we can get more details:

k -n mercury rollout history deploy cleaner
k -n mercury rollout history deploy cleaner --revision 1
k -n mercury rollout history deploy cleaner --revision 2
Check Pod statuses:

➜ k -n mercury get pod
NAME                       READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
cleaner-86b7758668-9pw6t   2/2     Running       0          6s
cleaner-86b7758668-qgh4v   0/2     Init:0/1      0          1s

➜ k -n mercury get pod
NAME                       READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
cleaner-86b7758668-9pw6t   2/2     Running       0          14s

Finally check the logs of the logging sidecar container:

➜ k -n mercury logs cleaner-576967576c-cqtgx -c logger-con

...
Mystery solved, something is removing files at random ;) It's important to understand how containers can communicate with each other using volumes.

 

 

# Question17 | InitContainer
Task weight: 4%

 

Last lunch you told your coworker from department Mars Inc how amazing InitContainers are. Now he would like to see one in action. There is a Deployment yaml at /opt/course/17/test-init-container.yaml. This Deployment spins up a single Pod of image nginx:1.17.3-alpine and serves files from a mounted volume, which is empty right now.

Create an InitContainer named init-con which also mounts that volume and creates a file index.html with content check this out! in the root of the mounted volume. For this test we ignore that it doesn't contain valid html.

The InitContainer should be using image busybox:1.31.0. Test your implementation for example using curl from a temporary nginx:alpine Pod.

 

Answer
cp /opt/course/17/test-init-container.yaml ~/17_test-init-container.yaml

vim 17_test-init-container.yaml
Add the InitContainer:

# 17_test-init-container.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: test-init-container
  namespace: mars
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: test-init-container
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: test-init-container
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: web-content
        emptyDir: {}
      initContainers:                 # initContainer start
      - name: init-con
        image: busybox:1.31.0
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "check this out!" > /tmp/web-content/index.html']
        volumeMounts:
        - name: web-content
          mountPath: /tmp/web-content # initContainer end
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.17.3-alpine
        name: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - name: web-content
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Then we create the Deployment:

k -f 17_test-init-container.yaml create
Finally we test the configuration:

k -n mars get pod -o wide # to get the cluster IP
➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl 10.0.0.67
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
check this out!
Beautiful.

 

 

# Question18 | Service misconfiguration
Task weight: 4%

 

There seems to be an issue in Namespace mars where the ClusterIP service manager-api-svc should make the Pods of Deployment manager-api-deployment available inside the cluster.

You can test this with curl manager-api-svc.mars:4444 from a temporary nginx:alpine Pod. Check for the misconfiguration and apply a fix.

 

Answer
First let's get an overview:

➜ k -n mars get all

deployment.apps/test-init-container      1/1     1            1           2m19s
...
Everything seems to be running, but we can't seem to get a connection:

➜ k -n mars run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 manager-api-svc:4444
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:01 --:--:--     0
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 1000 milliseconds
pod "tmp" deleted
pod mars/tmp terminated (Error)
Ok, let's try to connect to one pod directly:

k -n mars get pod -o wide # get cluster IP
➜ k -n mars run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 10.0.1.14
 % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
!DOCTYPE html
html
head
titleWelcome to nginx!/title
...
The Pods itself seem to work. Let's investigate the Service a bit:

➜ k -n mars describe service manager-api-svc
Name:              manager-api-svc
Namespace:         mars
Labels:            app=manager-api-svc
...
Endpoints:         none
...
Endpoint inspection is also possible using:

k -n mars get ep
No endpoints - No good. We check the Service yaml:

k -n mars edit service manager-api-svc
# k -n mars edit service manager-api-svc
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
...
  labels:
    app: manager-api-svc
  name: manager-api-svc
  namespace: mars
...
spec:
  clusterIP: 10.3.244.121
  ports:
  - name: 4444-80
    port: 4444
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    #id: manager-api-deployment # wrong selector, needs to point to pod!
    id: manager-api-pod
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
Though Pods are usually never created without a Deployment or ReplicaSet, Services always select for Pods directly. This gives great flexibility because Pods could be created through various customized ways. After saving the new selector we check the Service again for endpoints:

➜ k -n mars get ep
NAME              ENDPOINTS                                               AGE
manager-api-svc   10.0.0.30:80,10.0.1.30:80,10.0.1.31:80 + 1 more...      41m
Endpoints - Good! Now we try connecting again:

➜ k -n mars run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 manager-api-svc:4444
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

titleWelcome to nginx!/title
...
And we fixed it. Good to know is how to be able to use Kubernetes DNS resolution from a different Namespace. Not necessary, but we could spin up the temporary Pod in default Namespace:

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 manager-api-svc:4444
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

Short manager-api-svc.mars or long manager-api-svc.mars.svc.cluster.local work.

 

 

# Question19 | Service ClusterIP->NodePort
Task weight: 3%

 

In Namespace jupiter you'll find an apache Deployment (with one replica) named jupiter-crew-deploy and a ClusterIP Service called jupiter-crew-svc which exposes it. Change this service to a NodePort one to make it available on all nodes on port 30100.

Test the NodePort Service using the internal IP of all available nodes and the port 30100 using curl, you can reach the internal node IPs directly from your main terminal. On which nodes is the Service reachable? On which node is the Pod running?

 

Answer
First we get an overview:

➜ k -n jupiter get all
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/jupiter-crew-deploy-8cdf99bc9-klwqt   1/1     Running   0          34m

NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/jupiter-crew-svc   ClusterIP   10.100.254.66   none        8080/TCP   34m
...
(Optional) Next we check if the ClusterIP Service actually works:

➜ k -n jupiter run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 jupiter-crew-svc:8080
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    45  100    45    0     0   5000      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  5000
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
The Service is working great. Next we change the Service type to NodePort and set the port:

k -n jupiter edit service jupiter-crew-svc
# k -n jupiter edit service jupiter-crew-svc
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jupiter-crew-svc
  namespace: jupiter
...
spec:
  clusterIP: 10.3.245.70
  ports:
  - name: 8080-80
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30100 # add the nodePort
  selector:
    id: jupiter-crew
  sessionAffinity: None
  #type: ClusterIP
  type: NodePort    # change type
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
We check if the Service type was updated:

➜ k -n jupiter get svc
NAME               TYPE       CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
jupiter-crew-svc   NodePort   10.3.245.70   none        8080:30100/TCP   3m52s
(Optional) And we confirm that the service is still reachable internally:

➜ k -n jupiter run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 jupiter-crew-svc:8080
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
htmlbodyh1It works!/h1/body/html
Nice. A NodePort Service kind of lies on top of a ClusterIP one, making the ClusterIP Service reachable on the Node IPs (internal and external). Next we get the internal IPs of all nodes to check the connectivity:

➜ k get nodes -o wide
NAME                    STATUS   ROLES          AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP      ...
cluster1-controlplane1  Ready    control-plane  18h   v1.27.1   192.168.100.11   ...
cluster1-node1          Ready    none         18h   v1.27.1   192.168.100.12   ...
On which nodes is the Service reachable?

➜ curl 192.168.100.11:30100
htmlbodyh1It works!/h1/body/html

➜ curl 192.168.100.12:30100
htmlbodyh1It works!/h1/body/html
On both, even the controlplane. On which node is the Pod running?

➜ k -n jupiter get pod jupiter-crew-deploy-8cdf99bc9-klwqt -o yaml | grep nodeName
    nodeName: cluster1-node1
    
➜ k -n jupiter get pod -o wide # or even shorter
In our case on cluster1-node1, but could be any other worker if more available. Here we hopefully gained some insight into how a NodePort Service works. Although the Pod is just running on one specific node, the Service makes it available through port 30100 on the internal and external IP addresses of all nodes. This is at least the common/default behaviour but can depend on cluster configuration.

 

 

# Question20 | NetworkPolicy
Task weight: 9%

 

In Namespace venus you'll find two Deployments named api and frontend. Both Deployments are exposed inside the cluster using Services. Create a NetworkPolicy named np1 which restricts outgoing tcp connections from Deployment frontend and only allows those going to Deployment api. Make sure the NetworkPolicy still allows outgoing traffic on UDP/TCP ports 53 for DNS resolution.

Test using: wget www.google.com and wget api:2222 from a Pod of Deployment frontend.

 

Answer
 

INFO: For learning NetworkPolicies check out https://editor.cilium.io. But you're not allowed to use it during the exam.

 

First we get an overview:

➜ k -n venus get all

service/frontend   ClusterIP   10.3.255.135   none        80/TCP     57s
...
(Optional) This is not necessary but we could check if the Services are working inside the cluster:

➜ k -n venus run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=busybox -i -- wget -O- frontend:80
Connecting to frontend:80 (10.3.245.9:80)
<!DOCTYPE html>

Connecting to api:2222 (10.3.250.233:2222)
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
Then we use any frontend Pod and check if it can reach external names and the api Service:

➜ k -n venus exec frontend-789cbdc677-c9v8h -- wget -O- www.google.com
Connecting to www.google.com (216.58.205.227:80)

➜ k -n venus exec frontend-789cbdc677-c9v8h -- wget -O- api:2222     
It works!

-                    100% |********************************|    45  0:00:00 ETA
...
We see Pods of frontend can reach the api and external names.

vim 20_np1.yaml
Now we head to https://kubernetes.io/docs, search for NetworkPolicy, copy the example code and adjust it to:

# 20_np1.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: np1
  namespace: venus
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      id: frontend          # label of the pods this policy should be applied on
  policyTypes:
  - Egress                  # we only want to control egress
  egress:
  - to:                     # 1st egress rule
    - podSelector:            # allow egress only to pods with api label
        matchLabels:
          id: api
  - ports:                  # 2nd egress rule
    - port: 53                # allow DNS UDP
      protocol: UDP
    - port: 53                # allow DNS TCP
      protocol: TCP
Notice that we specify two egress rules in the yaml above. If we specify multiple egress rules then these are connected using a logical OR. So in the example above we do:

allow outgoing traffic if
  (destination pod has label id:api) OR ((port is 53 UDP) OR (port is 53 TCP))
Let's have a look at example code which wouldn't work in our case:

# this example does not work in our case
...
  egress:
  - to:                     # 1st AND ONLY egress rule
    - podSelector:            # allow egress only to pods with api label
        matchLabels:
          id: api
    ports:                  # STILL THE SAME RULE but just an additional selector
    - port: 53                # allow DNS UDP
      protocol: UDP
    - port: 53                # allow DNS TCP
      protocol: TCP
In the yaml above we only specify one egress rule with two selectors. It can be translated into:

allow outgoing traffic if
  (destination pod has label id:api) AND ((port is 53 UDP) OR (port is 53 TCP))
Apply the correct policy:

k -f 20_np1.yaml create
And try again, external is not working any longer:

➜ k -n venus exec frontend-789cbdc677-c9v8h -- wget -O- www.google.de 
Connecting to www.google.de:2222 (216.58.207.67:80)

➜ k -n venus exec frontend-789cbdc677-c9v8h -- wget -O- -T 5 www.google.de:80 
Connecting to www.google.com (172.217.203.104:80)
wget: download timed out
command terminated with exit code 1
Internal connection to api work as before:

➜ k -n venus exec frontend-789cbdc677-c9v8h -- wget -O- api:2222 
It works!

# Question21 | Requests and Limits, ServiceAccount
Task weight: 4%

 

Team Neptune needs 3 Pods of image httpd:2.4-alpine, create a Deployment named neptune-10ab for this. The containers should be named neptune-pod-10ab. Each container should have a memory request of 20Mi and a memory limit of 50Mi.

Team Neptune has it's own ServiceAccount neptune-sa-v2 under which the Pods should run. The Deployment should be in Namespace neptune.

 

Answer:
k -n neptune create deployment -h # help
k -n neptune create deploy -h # deploy is short for deployment

# check the export on the very top of this document so we can use $do
k -n neptune create deploy neptune-10ab --image=httpd:2.4-alpine $do > 21.yaml

vim 21.yaml
Now make the required changes using vim:

# 21.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: neptune-10ab
  name: neptune-10ab
  namespace: neptune
spec:
  replicas: 3                   # change
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: neptune-10ab
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: neptune-10ab
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: neptune-sa-v2 # add
      containers:
      - image: httpd:2.4-alpine
        name: neptune-pod-10ab  # change
        resources:              # add
          limits:               # add
            memory: 50Mi        # add
          requests:             # add
            memory: 20Mi        # add
status: {}
Then create the yaml:

k create -f 21.yaml # namespace already set in yaml
To verify all Pods are running we do:

➜ k -n neptune get pod | grep neptune-10ab
neptune-10ab-7d4b8d45b-4nzj5   1/1     Running            0          57s

If we would only like to get pods with certain labels we can run:

k -n sun get pod -l type=runner # only pods with label runner
We can use this label filtering also when using other commands, like setting new labels:

k label -h # help
k -n sun label pod -l type=runner protected=true # run for label runner
k -n sun label pod -l type=worker protected=true # run for label worker
Or we could run:

k -n sun label pod -l "type in (worker,runner)" protected=true
Let's check the result:

➜ k -n sun get pod --show-labels
NAME           ...   AGE   LABELS
0509649a       ...          56s   protected=true,type=runner,type_old=messenger

fdb2           ...          44s   protected=true,type=worker
Looking good. Finally we set the annotation using the newly assigned label protected: true:

k -n sun annotate pod -l protected=true protected="do not delete this pod"
Not requested in the task but for your own control you could run:

k -n sun get pod -l protected=true -o yaml | grep -A 8 metadata:
 

CKAD Simulator Preview Kubernetes 1.27
https://killer.sh

This is a preview of the full CKAD Simulator course content.

The full course contains 22 questions and scenarios which cover all the CKAD areas. The course also provides a browser terminal which is a very close replica of the original one. This is great to get used and comfortable before the real exam. After the test session (120 minutes), or if you stop it early, you'll get access to all questions and their detailed solutions. You'll have 36 hours cluster access in total which means even after the session, once you have the solutions, you can still play around.

The following preview will give you an idea of what the full course will provide. These preview questions are not part of the 22 in the full course but in addition to it. But the preview questions are part of the same CKAD simulation environment which we setup for you, so with access to the full course you can solve these too.

The answers provided here assume that you did run the initial terminal setup suggestions as provided in the tips section, but especially:

alias k=kubectl

export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"
 

These questions can be solved in the test environment provided through the CKA Simulator

 

Preview # Question1
In Namespace pluto there is a Deployment named project-23-api. It has been working okay for a while but Team Pluto needs it to be more reliable. Implement a liveness-probe which checks the container to be reachable on port 80. Initially the probe should wait 10, periodically 15 seconds.

The original Deployment yaml is available at /opt/course/p1/project-23-api.yaml. Save your changes at /opt/course/p1/project-23-api-new.yaml and apply the changes.

Answer
First we get an overview:

➜ k -n pluto get all -o wide
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    ... IP           ...
pod/holy-api                          1/1     Running   ... 10.12.0.26   ...
pod/project-23-api-784857f54c-dx6h6   1/1     Running   ... 10.12.2.15   ...
pod/project-23-api-784857f54c-sj8df   1/1     Running   ... 10.12.1.18   ...
pod/project-23-api-784857f54c-t4xmh   1/1     Running   ... 10.12.0.23   ...

NAME                             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   ...
deployment.apps/project-23-api   3/3     3            3           ...
To note: we see another Pod here called holy-api which is part of another section. This is often the case in the provided scenarios, so be careful to only manipulate the resources you need to. Just like in the real world and in the exam.

Next we use nginx:alpine and curl to check if one Pod is accessible on port 80:

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 10.12.2.15
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
Welcome to nginx!
...
We could also use busybox and wget for this:

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm --image=busybox -i -- wget -O- 10.12.2.15
Connecting to 10.12.2.15 (10.12.2.15:80)
writing to stdout
-                    100% |********************************|   612  0:00:00 ETA
written to stdout
<!DOCTYPE html>
Welcome to nginx!
Now that we're sure the Deployment works we can continue with altering the provided yaml:

cp /opt/course/p1/project-23-api.yaml /opt/course/p1/project-23-api-new.yaml
vim /opt/course/p1/project-23-api-new.yaml
Add the liveness-probe to the yaml:

# /opt/course/p1/project-23-api-new.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: project-23-api
  namespace: pluto
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: project-23-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: project-23-api
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: cache-volume1
        emptyDir: {}
      - name: cache-volume2
        emptyDir: {}
      - name: cache-volume3
        emptyDir: {}
      containers:
      - image: httpd:2.4-alpine
        name: httpd
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /cache1
          name: cache-volume1
        - mountPath: /cache2
          name: cache-volume2
        - mountPath: /cache3
          name: cache-volume3
        env:
        - name: APP_ENV
          value: "prod"
        - name: APP_SECRET_N1
          value: "IO=a4L/XkRdvN8jM=Y+"
        - name: APP_SECRET_P1
          value: "-7PA0_Z]>{pwa43r)__"
        livenessProbe:                  # add
          tcpSocket:                    # add
            port: 80                    # add
          initialDelaySeconds: 10       # add
          periodSeconds: 15             # add
Then let's apply the changes:

k -f /opt/course/p1/project-23-api-new.yaml apply 
Next we wait 10 seconds and confirm the Pods are still running:

➜ k -n pluto get pod
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
holy-api                          1/1     Running   0          144m
project-23-api-5b4579fd49-8knh8   1/1     Running   0          90s
project-23-api-5b4579fd49-cbgph   1/1     Running   0          88s
project-23-api-5b4579fd49-tcfq5   1/1     Running   0          86s
We can also check the configured liveness-probe settings on a Pod or the Deployment:

➜ k -n pluto describe pod project-23-api-5b4579fd49-8knh8 | grep Liveness
    Liveness:   tcp-socket :80 delay=10s timeout=1s period=15s #success=1 #failure=3
    
➜  k -n pluto describe deploy project-23-api | grep Liveness
    Liveness:   tcp-socket :80 delay=10s timeout=1s period=15s #success=1 #failure=3
 

 

Preview # Question2
Team Sun needs a new Deployment named sunny with 4 replicas of image nginx:1.17.3-alpine in Namespace sun. The Deployment and its Pods should use the existing ServiceAccount sa-sun-deploy.

Expose the Deployment internally using a ClusterIP Service named sun-srv on port 9999. The nginx containers should run as default on port 80. The management of Team Sun would like to execute a command to check that all Pods are running on occasion. Write that command into file /opt/course/p2/sunny_status_command.sh. The command should use kubectl.

Answer
k -n sun create deployment -h #help

# check the export on the very top of this document so we can use $do
k -n sun create deployment sunny --image=nginx:1.17.3-alpine $do > p2_sunny.yaml

vim p2_sunny.yaml
Then alter its yaml to include the requirements:

# p2_sunny.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: sunny
  name: sunny
  namespace: sun
spec:
  replicas: 4                               # change
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sunny
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: sunny
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: sa-sun-deploy     # add
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.17.3-alpine
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
status: {}
Now create the yaml and confirm it's running:

➜ k create -f p2_sunny.yaml 
deployment.apps/sunny created

➜ k -n sun get pod
NAME                     READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
0509649a                 1/1     Running       0          149m
0509649b                 1/1     Running       0          149m
1428721e                 1/1     Running       0          149m
...
sunny-64df8dbdbb-9mxbw   1/1     Running       0          10s
sunny-64df8dbdbb-mp5cf   1/1     Running       0          10s
sunny-64df8dbdbb-pggdf   1/1     Running       0          6s
sunny-64df8dbdbb-zvqth   1/1     Running       0          7s
Confirmed, the AGE column is always in important information about if changes were applied. Next we expose the Pods by created the Service:

k -n sun expose -h # help
k -n sun expose deployment sunny --name sun-srv --port 9999 --target-port 80
Using expose instead of kubectl create service clusterip is faster because it already sets the correct selector-labels. The previous command would produce this yaml:

# k -n sun expose deployment sunny --name sun-srv --port 9999 --target-port 80
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: sunny
  name: sun-srv         # required by task
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 9999          # service port
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80      # target port
  selector:
    app: sunny          # selector is important
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
Let's test the Service using wget from a temporary Pod:

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 sun-srv.sun:9999
Connecting to sun-srv.sun:9999 (10.23.253.120:9999)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
...
Because the Service is in a different Namespace as our temporary Pod, it is reachable using the names sun-srv.sun or fully: sun-srv.sun.svc.cluster.local.

Finally we need a command which can be executed to check if all Pods are runing, this can be done with:

vim /opt/course/p2/sunny_status_command.sh
# /opt/course/p2/sunny_status_command.sh
kubectl -n sun get deployment sunny
To run the command:

➜ sh /opt/course/p2/sunny_status_command.sh
NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
sunny   4/4     4            4           13m
 

 

Preview # Question3
Management of EarthAG recorded that one of their Services stopped working. Dirk, the administrator, left already for the long weekend. All the information they could give you is that it was located in Namespace earth and that it stopped working after the latest rollout. All Services of EarthAG should be reachable from inside the cluster.

Find the Service, fix any issues and confirm it's working again. Write the reason of the error into file /opt/course/p3/ticket-654.txt so Dirk knows what the issue was.

First impression could be that all Pods are in status RUNNING. But looking closely we see that some of the Pods are not ready, which also confirms what we see about one Deployment and one replicaset. This could be our error to further investigate.

Another approach could be to check the Services for missing endpoints:

➜ k -n earth get ep
NAME                ENDPOINTS                                           AGE
earth-2x3-api-svc   10.0.0.10:80,10.0.1.5:80,10.0.2.4:80                116m
earth-2x3-web-svc   10.0.0.11:80,10.0.0.12:80,10.0.1.6:80 + 3 more...   116m
earth-3cc-web           
Service earth-3cc-web doesn't have endpoints. This could be a selector/label misconfiguration or the endpoints are actually not available/ready.

Checking all Services for connectivity should show the same (this step is optional and just for demonstration):

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 earth-2x3-api-svc.earth:4546
...
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 earth-2x3-web-svc.earth:4545
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    45  100    45    0     0   5000      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  5000
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 earth-3cc-web.earth:6363
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:05 --:--:--     0
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 5000 milliseconds
pod "tmp" deleted
pod default/tmp terminated (Error)
Notice that we use here for example earth-2x3-api-svc.earth. We could also spin up a temporary Pod in Namespace earth and connect directly to earth-2x3-api-svc.

We get no connection to earth-3cc-web.earth:6363. Let's look at the Deployment earth-3cc-web. Here we see that the requested amount of replicas is not available/ready:

➜ k -n earth get deploy earth-3cc-web
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
earth-3cc-web   0/4     4            0           7m18s
To continue we check the Deployment yaml for some misconfiguration:

k -n earth edit deploy earth-3cc-web
# k -n earth edit deploy earth-3cc-web
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
...
  generation: 3                     # there have been rollouts
  name: earth-3cc-web
  namespace: earth
...
spec:
...
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        id: earth-3cc-web
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.16.1-alpine
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: nginx
        readinessProbe:
          failureThreshold: 3
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 20
          successThreshold: 1
          tcpSocket:
            port: 82                # this port doesn't seem to be right, should be 80
          timeoutSeconds: 1
...
We change the readiness-probe port, save and check the Pods:

➜ k -n earth get pod -l id=earth-3cc-web
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
earth-3cc-web-d49645966-52vb9   0/1     Running   0          6s
earth-3cc-web-d49645966-5tts6   0/1     Running   0          6s
earth-3cc-web-d49645966-db5gp   0/1     Running   0          6s
earth-3cc-web-d49645966-mk7gr   0/1     Running   0          6s
Running, but still not in ready state. Wait 10 seconds (initialDelaySeconds of readinessProbe) and check again:

➜ k -n earth get pod -l id=earth-3cc-web
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
earth-3cc-web-d49645966-52vb9   1/1     Running   0          32s
earth-3cc-web-d49645966-5tts6   1/1     Running   0          32s
earth-3cc-web-d49645966-db5gp   1/1     Running   0          32s
earth-3cc-web-d49645966-mk7gr   1/1     Running   0          32s
Let's check the service again:

➜ k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl -m 5 earth-3cc-web.earth:6363
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   612  100   612    0     0  55636      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 55636

The Test Environment / Browser Terminal
You'll be provided with a browser terminal which uses Ubuntu 20. The standard shells included with a minimal install of Ubuntu 20 will be available, including bash.

Laggin

There could be some lagging, definitely make sure you are using a good internet connection because your webcam and screen are uploading all the time.

Kubectl autocompletion and commands

Autocompletion is configured by default, as well as the k alias source and others:

kubectl with k alias and Bash autocompletion

yq and jqfor YAML/JSON processing

tmux for terminal multiplexing

curl and wget for testing web services

man and man pages for further documentation

Copy & Paste

There could be issues copying text (like pod names) from the left task information into the terminal. Some suggested to "hard" hit or long hold Cmd/Ctrl+C a few times to take action. Apart from that copy and paste should just work like in normal terminals.

Percentages and Score

There are 15-20 questions in the exam and 100% of total percentage to reach. Each questions shows the % it gives if you solve it. Your results will be automatically checked according to the handbook. If you don't agree with the results you can request a review by contacting the Linux Foundation support.

Notepad & Skipping Questions

You have access to a simple notepad in the browser which can be used for storing any kind of plain text. It makes sense to use this for saving skipped # Questionnumbers and their percentages. This way it's possible to move some questions to the end. It might make sense to skip 2% or 3% questions and go directly to higher ones.

Contexts

You'll receive access to various different clusters and resources in each. They provide you the exact command you need to run to connect to another cluster/context. But you should be comfortable working in different namespaces with kubectl.

 

PSI Bridge
Starting with PSI Bridge:

The exam will now be taken using the PSI Secure Browser, which can be downloaded using the newest versions of Microsoft Edge, Safari, Chrome, or Firefox
Multiple monitors will no longer be permitted
Use of personal bookmarks will no longer be permitted
The new ExamUI includes improved features such as:

A remote desktop configured with the tools and software needed to complete the tasks
A timer that displays the actual time remaining (in minutes) and provides an alert with 30, 15, or 5 minute remaining
The content panel remains the same (presented on the Left Hand Side of the ExamUI)
Read more here.

 

Browser Terminal Setup
It should be considered to spend ~1 minute in the beginning to setup your terminal. In the real exam the vast majority of questions will be done from the main terminal. For few you might need to ssh into another machine. Just be aware that configurations to your shell will not be transferred in this case.

Minimal Setup
Alias

The alias k for kubectl will already be configured together with autocompletion. In case not you can configure it using this link.

Vim

The following settings will already be configured in your real exam environment in ~/.vimrc. But it can never hurt to be able to type these down:

set tabstop=2
set expandtab
set shiftwidth=2
The expandtab make sure to use spaces for tabs. Memorize these and just type them down. You can't have any written notes with commands on your desktop etc.

Optional Setup
Fast dry-run output

export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"
This way you can just run k run pod1 --image=nginx $do. Short for "dry output", but use whatever name you like.

Fast pod delete

export now="--force --grace-period 0"
This way you can run k delete pod1 $now and don't have to wait for ~30 seconds termination time.

Persist bash settings

You can store aliases and other setup in ~/.bashrc if you're planning on using different shells or tmux.

Alias Namespace

In addition you could define an alias like:

alias kn='kubectl config set-context --current --namespace '
Which allows you to define the default namespace of the current context. Then once you switch a context or namespace you can just run:

kn default        # set default to default
kn my-namespace   # set default to my-namespace
But only do this if you used it before and are comfortable doing so. Else you need to specify the namespace for every call, which is also fine:

k -n my-namespace get all
k -n my-namespace get pod
...
 

Be fast
Use the history command to reuse already entered commands or use even faster history search through Ctrl r .

If a command takes some time to execute, like sometimes kubectl delete pod x. You can put a task in the background using Ctrl z and pull it back into foreground running command fg.

You can delete pods fast with:

k delete pod x --grace-period 0 --force

k delete pod x $now # if export from above is configured
 

Vim
Be great with vim.

toggle vim line numbers

When in vim you can press Esc and type :set number or :set nonumber followed by Enter to toggle line numbers. This can be useful when finding syntax errors based on line - but can be bad when wanting to mark&copy by mouse. You can also just jump to a line number with Esc :22 + Enter.

copy&paste

Get used to copy/paste/cut with vim:

Mark lines: Esc+V (then arrow keys)
Copy marked lines: y
Cut marked lines: d
Past lines: p or P
Indent multiple lines

To indent multiple lines press Esc and type :set shiftwidth=2. First mark multiple lines using Shift v and the up/down keys. Then to indent the marked lines press > or <. You can then press . to repeat the action.

 

Split terminal screen
By default tmux is installed and can be used to split your one terminal into multiple. But just do this if you know your shit, because scrolling is different and copy&pasting might be weird.
