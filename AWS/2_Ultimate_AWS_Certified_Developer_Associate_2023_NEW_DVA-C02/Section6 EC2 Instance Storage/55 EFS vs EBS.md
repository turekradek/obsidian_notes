Sure, here is a summary of the differences between EBS volumes and EFS file systems:

|Feature|EBS Volumes|EFS File Systems|
|---|---|---|
|Attachment|Attached to one instance at a time (except for multi-attach)|Attached to hundreds of instances across availability zones|
|Availability Zone|Locked at the AZ level|Multiple mount targets in different AZs|
|Scaling|IO increases with disk size|IO can be increased independently|
|Migration|Requires snapshot and restore|Can be mounted in different AZs without migration|
|Backups|Consume IO and should not be run during high traffic|Do not consume IO|
|Termination|Root EBS volumes are terminated by default|Not terminated by default|
|Cost|Lower price point|Higher price point, but can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings|
|Use cases|General-purpose storage|Large-scale file sharing, such as WordPress|
|Durability|Physically attached to the EC2 instance|Network file system|
