Here are the steps from the description of the hand-on:

1. Create a bucket with a unique name and a region.
2. Upload objects to the bucket.
3. View objects in the bucket.
4. Create a folder in the bucket.
5. Upload objects to the folder.
6. Delete the folder and its contents.

**Creating a bucket**

- When creating a bucket, you must choose a unique name and a region. The bucket name must be globally unique across all AWS accounts and regions. The region is where the bucket will be physically located.
- You can also configure other settings when creating a bucket, such as object ownership, public access blocking, and versioning.

**Uploading objects**

- You can upload objects to a bucket using the AWS Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.
- Objects can be any type of file, such as images, videos, documents, and code.
- The maximum object size is 5 terabytes. If you need to upload a larger file, you can use the multi-part upload feature.

**Viewing objects**

- You can view objects in a bucket using the AWS Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.
- When you view an object, you can see its properties, such as its size, type, and creation date.
- You can also download the object to your local computer.

**Creating a folder**

- You can create folders in a bucket to organize your objects.
- Folders are not a physical concept in Amazon S3. Instead, they are simply a way to group objects together in a logical way.
- To create a folder, you can use the AWS Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.

**Uploading objects to a folder**

- To upload an object to a folder, you must first select the folder.
- You can then upload the object using the AWS Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.

**Deleting a folder and its contents**

- To delete a folder, you must first empty it.
- You can delete individual objects from a folder using the AWS Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.
- Once the folder is empty, you can delete it using the AWS Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK.

**Additional notes**

- You can also use Amazon S3 pre-signed URLs to allow others to access your objects without having to provide their AWS credentials.
- Amazon S3 offers a variety of other features, such as lifecycle management, encryption, and analytics.

I hope this is helpful!

**Additional notes:**

- You can also use the AWS CLI or the AWS SDK to create buckets, upload objects, and perform other Amazon S3 tasks.
- To make an object public, you can edit the bucket's object ownership permissions or use the `putObjectAcl` API.
- You can also use Amazon S3 pre-signed URLs to allow others to access your objects without having to provide their AWS credentials.
