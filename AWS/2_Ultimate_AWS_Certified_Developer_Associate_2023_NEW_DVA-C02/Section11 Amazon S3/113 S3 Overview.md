- Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service that can be used for a wide variety of use cases, including backup and storage, disaster recovery, archival, hybrid cloud storage, hosting applications, hosting media, storing data for big data analytics, and delivering software updates.
- Amazon S3 stores files in buckets, which are logical containers for objects. Buckets must have a globally unique name and must be defined in a specific AWS region.
- Amazon S3 objects are files that have a key, which is the full path of the file. Keys can be decomposed into a prefix and an object name.
- Amazon S3 does not have a concept of directories per se, but the UI makes it look like there are directories.
- The maximum object size is 5 terabytes. If you need to upload a file that is larger than 5 terabytes, you must use the multi-part upload feature.
- Objects can have metadata, tags, and a version ID (if versioning is enabled).

Here are some examples of how Amazon S3 is used in the real world:

- The Nasdaq stores seven years of data in Amazon S3 Glacier, the archival service for Amazon S3.
- Sysco runs analytics on its data in Amazon S3 to gain business insights.

Overall, Amazon S3 is a powerful and versatile object storage service that can be used to meet a wide variety of needs.
