**What is Amazon S3 versioning?**

Amazon S3 versioning is a feature that can be enabled on S3 buckets to keep multiple versions of each object in the bucket. When versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 keeps all object versions, including deleted versions.

**Why enable Amazon S3 versioning?**

There are several benefits to enabling Amazon S3 versioning:

- **Protects against unintended deletes:** If you delete a file version, Amazon S3 actually adds a delete marker, which means that you can still restore the file version.
- **Allows you to roll back to a previous version:** If you make a mistake or change your mind, you can easily roll back to a previous version of a file.
- **Provides a complete audit trail of all changes to objects in the bucket:** This can be useful for compliance or auditing purposes.

**How to enable Amazon S3 versioning**

To enable Amazon S3 versioning on a bucket:

1. Go to the Amazon S3 console.
2. Click the name of the bucket that you want to enable versioning on.
3. Click the **Properties** tab.
4. Under **Versioning**, click **Edit**.
5. Select the **Enable** checkbox.
6. Click **Save changes**.

**Important notes**

- Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have the version `null`.
- Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions of objects in the bucket.

**Using versioning in the console**

To view and manage object versions in the Amazon S3 console:

1. Go to the Amazon S3 console.
2. Click the name of the bucket that contains the object versions that you want to view or manage.
3. Click the **Versions** tab.
4. To view the contents of an object version, click the version ID.
5. To restore an object version, click **Restore**.
6. To delete an object version, click **Delete**.

**Conclusion**

Amazon S3 versioning is a powerful feature that can help you protect your data and recover from mistakes. It is best practice to enable versioning on all S3 buckets that contain important data.
