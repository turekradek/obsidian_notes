**Managing Multiple AWS Accounts**

- Use profiles to manage multiple AWS accounts.
    
- Create a new profile using the `aws configure --profile` command.
    
- Specify the profile name, access key ID, secret access key, and region for the new profile.
    
- Use the `--profile` command-line argument to specify the profile to use when running AWS CLI commands.
    

**Benefits of Using Profiles**

- Allows you to easily switch between different AWS accounts.
    
- Keeps your credentials for different accounts separate.
    
- Prevents you from accidentally using the wrong credentials.
    

**Additional Notes**

- Profiles are not required for the AWS Certification exam, but they are a valuable tool for managing multiple AWS accounts in real-world scenarios.
    
- Using profiles can help you to avoid making mistakes and to keep your AWS accounts organized.
