**AWS SDK Overview**

- An SDK (software development kit) is a tool that allows developers to interact with AWS services from within their applications.
    
- AWS provides official SDKs for a variety of programming languages, including Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, Go, Ruby, and C++.
    
- The AWS CLI, which we have been using throughout this course, is actually written in Python and uses the Boto3 SDK.
    
- The exam expects you to know when to use an SDK and when to use the AWS CLI.
    
- SDKs are generally used for more complex applications where you need more control over the API calls that are being made.
    
- The AWS CLI is a good choice for simpler tasks or for situations where you need to quickly execute commands.
    
- If you do not specify a region when using an SDK, the us-east-1 region will be chosen by default.
