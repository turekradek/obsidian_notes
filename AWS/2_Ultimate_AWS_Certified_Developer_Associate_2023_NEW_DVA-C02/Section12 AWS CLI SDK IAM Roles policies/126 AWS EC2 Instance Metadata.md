  
Sure, here is a summary of the lecture on EC2 instance metadata (IMDS):

**EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**

- Allows EC2 instances to learn about themselves without using an IAM Role.
    
- Accessible at the URL 169.254.169.254.
    
- Provides information about the instance, such as its name, public IP, private IP, and IAM Role name.
    
- Can also retrieve credentials from the instance metadata, but not the IAM policy attached to the role.
    

**IMDSv1 vs. IMDSv2**

- IMDSv1 is the older version of the IMDS and is accessed directly at the URL 169.254.169.254.
    
- IMDSv2 is the newer version of the IMDS and is more secure. To access IMDSv2, you must first get a session token by using a PUT command and then call the IMDS URL with the token as a header.
    

**Additional Notes**

- IMDS is a powerful feature that is not well-known by many developers.
    
- IMDS can be used to retrieve information about the instance, such as its name, public IP, private IP, and IAM Role name.
    
- IMDS can also be used to retrieve credentials from the instance metadata.
    
- IMDSv2 is a more secure version of IMDS and is enabled by default on new EC2 instances.
