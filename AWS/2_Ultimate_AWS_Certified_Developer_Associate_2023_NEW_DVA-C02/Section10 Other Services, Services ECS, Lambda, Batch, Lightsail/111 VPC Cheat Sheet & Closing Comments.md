here is a summary of the key concepts from the lecture on VPCs:

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a private network within the AWS cloud that allows you to deploy your resources in a secure and isolated environment.
    
- **Subnets** are network partitions of a VPC. They are tied to a specific Availability Zone.
    
- **Internet Gateway** gives access to instances in public subnets to the internet.
    
- **NAT Gateways** and **NAT Instances** give internet access to instances in private subnets.
    
- **Network ACLs (NACLs)** are stateless subnet rules firewalls for inbound and outbound traffic.
    
- **Security Groups** are stateful firewalls that operate at the EC2 instance or ENI level. They can reference other security groups.
    
- **VPC Peering** allows you to connect two VPCs together as long as their IP ranges are not overlapping.
    
- **VPC Endpoints** provide private access to AWS services within your VPC.
    
- **VPC Flow Logs** give you network traffic logs to help you debug connectivity issues.
    
- **Site-to-Site VPN** establishes a VPN connection over the public internet between your on-premises data center and AWS.
    
- **Direct Connect** establishes a direct private connection between your on-premises data center and AWS.
