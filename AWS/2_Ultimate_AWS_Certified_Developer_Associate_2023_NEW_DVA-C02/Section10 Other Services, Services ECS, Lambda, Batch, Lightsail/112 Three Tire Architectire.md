**Typical Three-Tier Solution Architecture**

- **Web Application Tier:**
    
    - Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for distributing traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
        
    - Auto Scaling Group for automatically adding or removing EC2 instances based on demand.
        
    
- **Application Tier:**
    
    - EC2 instances running the web application code.
    
- **Data Tier:**
    
    - Amazon RDS for storing and managing data.
        
    - ElastiCache for caching data from RDS.
        
    

**LAMP Stack on EC2**

- Linux operating system for EC2 instances.
    
- Apache web server.
    
- MySQL database.
    
- PHP application logic.
    

**WordPress on AWS**

- Similar architecture to typical three-tier solution architecture.
    
- Uses EFS (Elastic File System) to store and share images.
    

**Additional Notes**

- The typical three-tier solution architecture is a common pattern for deploying web applications on AWS.
    
- The LAMP Stack is a popular software stack for web development.
    
- EFS is a good option for storing and sharing files across multiple EC2 instances.
    
- The WordPress architecture on AWS is a good example of how to use multiple AWS services to create a scalable and reliable web application.
