Sure, here is a summary of the steps to create an Amazon RDS database instance using the standard create method:

1. **Select the database engine.** In this case, MySQL 8.0.28 is chosen.
2. **Choose a template.** A production template is selected, but the options will be modified to remain within the free tier.
3. **Configure availability and durability.** A Single DB instance is chosen to stay within the free tier.
4. **Set the DB identifier, credentials, and instance class.** The DB identifier is set to `database-1`, the credentials are `admin` and a password, and the instance class is set to `db.t2.micro`.
5. **Configure storage.** A gp2 type of EBS volume is chosen with 20 gigabytes of allocated storage. Storage autoscaling is also enabled with a maximum storage amount of 1000 gigabytes.
6. **Set connectivity options.** The database is not connected to an EC2 compute resource. Instead, it is deployed in a specified VPC with a subnet group and public access enabled.
7. **Create a new security group.** The security group is named `demo-database-mysql` and allows inbound connections on port 3306.
8. **Enable password authentication for the database.** IAM database authentication and Kerberos are not enabled.
