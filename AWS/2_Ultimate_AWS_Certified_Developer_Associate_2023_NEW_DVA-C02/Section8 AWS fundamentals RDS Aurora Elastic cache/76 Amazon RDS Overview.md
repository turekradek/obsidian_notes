**What is RDS?**

RDS is a managed database service for relational databases that use SQL as a query language. It allows you to create and manage databases in the cloud, and these databases are managed by AWS.

**Benefits of using RDS**

There are many benefits to using RDS compared to deploying your own database service on an EC2 instance. These benefits include:

- **Provisioning:** RDS provisioning is fully automated.
- **Patching:** RDS automatically patches the underlying operating system.
- **Backups:** RDS provides continuous backups and Point in Time Restore.
- **Monitoring:** RDS provides monitoring dashboards to view the performance of your database.
- **Read replicas:** RDS supports read replicas to improve read performance.
- **Multi-AZ:** RDS supports multi-AZ deployments for disaster recovery.
- **Maintenance:** RDS provides maintenance windows for upgrades.
- **Scaling:** RDS supports both vertical and horizontal scaling.
- **Storage:** RDS storage is backed by EBS gp2 or io1 volumes.

**RDS Storage Auto Scaling**

RDS Storage Auto Scaling is a feature that allows you to automatically scale your RDS storage up or down based on your needs. This is helpful for applications that have unpredictable workloads.

**How to enable RDS Storage Auto Scaling**

To enable RDS Storage Auto Scaling, you need to do the following:

1. Set a maximum storage threshold.
2. Enable automatic storage modification.
3. Set the thresholds for when storage should be increased or decreased.

RDS Storage Auto Scaling supports all database engines for RDS, including MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.
