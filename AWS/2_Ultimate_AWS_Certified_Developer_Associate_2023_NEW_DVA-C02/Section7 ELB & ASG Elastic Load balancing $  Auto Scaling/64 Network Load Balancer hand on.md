  
Sure, here is a summary of the hands-on lecture on creating a Network Load Balancer (NLB):

**Creating a Network Load Balancer**

1. Create a security group for your NLB.
2. Create a target group for your EC2 instances.
3. Create an NLB listener on port 80.
4. Map the listener to the target group.
5. Configure the health checks for the target group.
6. Register your EC2 instances with the target group.
7. Create the NLB.

**Troubleshooting Issues with the NLB**

- If your EC2 instances are unhealthy, check the security group of the instances to make sure that they allow traffic from the NLB.
- If your NLB is not distributing traffic to your EC2 instances, check the listener and target group configuration to make sure that they are configured correctly.

**Deleting the NLB**

1. Delete the NLB.
2. Optionally, delete the target group.
3. Optionally, delete the security groups of the NLB.
