Here is a summary of the different metrics that can be used to scale an Auto Scaling Group:

- CPU utilization
- Request counts per target
- Network in or out
- Custom metrics

Here is a summary of the scaling cooldown:

- The scaling cooldown is a period of time after a scaling action occurs during which the ASG will not launch or terminate additional instances.
- The default scaling cooldown is five minutes or 300 seconds.
- The scaling cooldown can be decreased to allow for more dynamic scaling.

Here are some additional tips for using Auto Scaling Groups:

- Use a ready-to-use AMI to reduce the configuration time for your EC2 instances.
- Enable detailed monitoring for ASG to get access to lower-level metrics.
- Make sure that your metrics are being updated fast enough.
