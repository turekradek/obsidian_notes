- manual scaling: update the size of an ASG manually
- dynamic scaling: respond to changing demand
	- simple / step scaling
		- when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered ( example CPU > 70 %) then add 2 units
		- when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered ( example CPU < 70 %) then remove 1
	- target tracking scaling
		- example: I want the average ASG VPU to stay at around 40%
	- scheduled scaling
		- anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
		- Example: increase the min capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays
### Auto scaling Groups - scalin stategies
- Predictive Scaling
	- Uses Machine Learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
	- Automatically provisions the right number of EC2 instances in advance
- Useful when your load has predictable time-based patterns
