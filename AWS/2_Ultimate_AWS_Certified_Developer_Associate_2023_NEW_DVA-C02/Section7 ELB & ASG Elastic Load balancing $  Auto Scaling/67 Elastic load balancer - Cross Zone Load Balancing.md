**What is cross zone load balancing?**

Cross zone load balancing is a feature of Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) that allows you to distribute traffic evenly across all of your EC2 instances, regardless of which Availability Zone (AZ) they are in. This can help to improve performance and availability by ensuring that no single AZ is overloaded.

**Enabling cross zone load balancing**

Cross zone load balancing is enabled by default for Application Load Balancers (ALBs). However, you can disable it at the target group level. For Network Load Balancers (NLBs) and Gateway Load Balancers (GLBs), cross zone load balancing is disabled by default. You can enable it at the load balancer level, but you will be charged for inter-AZ data transfers.

**Benefits of cross zone load balancing**

- **Improved performance:** Cross zone load balancing can help to improve performance by distributing traffic evenly across all of your EC2 instances. This can help to reduce latency and improve throughput.
- **Increased availability:** Cross zone load balancing can help to increase availability by ensuring that your application remains available even if one AZ goes down. This is because traffic will be routed to other AZs.

**Drawbacks of cross zone load balancing**

- **Increased complexity:** Cross zone load balancing can increase the complexity of your application, as you need to manage data transfers between AZs.
- **Potential for increased costs:** If you enable cross zone load balancing for NLBs and GLBs, you will be charged for inter-AZ data transfers.

**Overall, cross zone load balancing is a useful feature that can help to improve performance and availability. However, you should carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks before enabling it for your application.**
