**What is Auto Scaling Groups Instance Refresh?**

Auto Scaling Groups Instance Refresh is a feature of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling that allows you to update the EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group without disrupting traffic to your application. This is done by replacing the old instances with new ones that are created from a new launch template.

**How does Auto Scaling Groups Instance Refresh work?**

To use Auto Scaling Groups Instance Refresh, you will need to create a new launch template that specifies the new AMI and other settings that you want for your EC2 instances. Then, you can start an instance refresh by calling the StartInstanceRefresh API.

When you start an instance refresh, Auto Scaling will begin terminating instances in your Auto Scaling group. The minimum healthy percentage that you specify will determine how many instances can be terminated at a time. New instances will be launched from the new launch template and will replace the terminated instances.

You can also specify a warm-up time for your instance refresh. This is the amount of time that Auto Scaling will wait after launching a new instance before considering it to be healthy.
