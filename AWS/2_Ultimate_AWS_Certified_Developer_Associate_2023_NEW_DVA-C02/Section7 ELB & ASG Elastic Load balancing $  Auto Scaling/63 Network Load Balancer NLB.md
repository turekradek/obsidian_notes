Sure, here is a summary of the lecture on the Network Load Balancer (NLB):

**What is a Network Load Balancer (NLB)?**

A Network Load Balancer (NLB) is a Layer 4 load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. It supports TCP and UDP traffic, and it is designed for applications that require high performance and low latency.

**How Does an NLB Work?**

An NLB works by distributing incoming traffic across a collection of target groups. Each target group is a collection of EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. The NLB uses a variety of algorithms to route traffic to the target groups, including round-robin, weighted, and least connections.

**Benefits of Using an NLB**

- **High performance:** NLBs can handle millions of requests per second.
- **Low latency:** NLBs have a latency of around 100 milliseconds, compared to 400 milliseconds for Application Load Balancers (ALBs).
- **Static IP addresses:** NLBs have one static IP address per Availability Zone.
- **Elastic IP addresses:** You can assign an Elastic IP to each Availability Zone (AZ) with an NLB. This can be helpful when you need to expose your application with a set of static IPs.

**How to Use an NLB**

1. Create a target group for your EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses.
2. Create an NLB listener on the port that you want to use for your application.
3. Create an NLB rule that maps the listener to the target group.

**Health Checks**

NLB target groups support three different types of health checks: TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS. You can define a health check on the protocol that your backend application supports.

**Combination with Application Load Balancers (ALBs)**

It is possible to have an NLB in front of an ALB. In this case, the NLB would provide the fixed IP addresses, and the ALB would provide the rules for handling HTTP traffic.
