**Weighted routing policies** are a type of routing policy in Route 53 that allows you to control the percentage of requests that are routed to each resource in a record set. This is done by assigning each resource a weight, which is a number that represents the relative proportion of traffic that should be sent to that resource. For example, if you have three resources with weights of 70, 20, and 10, then 70% of the requests will be routed to the first resource, 20% of the requests will be routed to the second resource, and 10% of the requests will be routed to the third resource.

**Weighted routing policies** are useful for a number of purposes, including:

- **Load balancing:** You can use weighted routing policies to distribute traffic across multiple resources, which can help to improve the performance and availability of your applications.
- **Testing new application versions:** You can use weighted routing policies to test a new version of an application by sending a small amount of traffic to it, while still routing the majority of traffic to the stable version.
- **Gradually shifting traffic to a new resource:** You can use weighted routing policies to gradually shift traffic from one resource to another, which can be helpful when you are migrating applications to a new infrastructure.

**Weighted routing policies** can be applied to A and AAAA records. They can also be combined with health checks to ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy resources.

**Creating a weighted routing policy** is simple. In the Route 53 console, select the record you want to apply the weighted routing policy to, and then click on the "Routing policy" tab. Select the "Weighted" routing policy type, and then enter the weights for each resource in the record set.

**Weighted routing policies** are a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance and availability of your applications.

**Weighted routing policies** are a type of routing policy in Amazon Route 53 that allows you to distribute traffic across multiple resources based on predefined weights. This approach is particularly useful for load balancing applications and gradually shifting traffic to new resources during migrations.

**Key features of weighted routing policies:**

- **Flexible traffic distribution:** Specify weights for each resource to determine the percentage of traffic directed to each.
    
- **Load balancing:** Effectively distribute traffic across multiple resources to enhance performance and availability.
    
- **Application version testing:** Route a small portion of traffic to a new application version for testing while maintaining stability for the majority of users.
    
- **Gradual resource migration:** Smoothly transition traffic from an existing resource to a new one without disrupting users.
    

**Application of weighted routing policies:**

- **A and AAAA records:** Weighted routing policies can be applied to both A and AAAA records, providing flexibility in routing DNS queries.
    
- **Health checks integration:** Combine weighted routing policies with health checks to ensure traffic is directed only to healthy resources, maintaining application reliability.
    

**Implementing weighted routing policies:**

2. **Create a DNS record:** Select the desired domain name and record type (A or AAAA) for the weighted routing policy.
    
4. **Assign weights:** Specify the weight for each resource in the record set, determining the proportion of traffic directed to each.
    
6. **Health check configuration (optional):** Associate health checks with the record set to ensure traffic routing only to healthy resources.
    
8. **Record creation:** Save the record to activate the weighted routing policy, distributing traffic according to the specified weights.
    

**Benefits of weighted routing policies:**

- **Improved performance:** Efficiently distribute traffic across multiple resources, reducing latency and enhancing application responsiveness.
    
- **Enhanced availability:** Ensure continuous service delivery by routing traffic away from unhealthy resources and maintaining system uptime.
    
- **Controlled application version testing:** Safely test new application versions without impacting the majority of users, enabling confident rollouts.
    
- **Smooth resource migrations:** Seamlessly transition traffic to new resources without disrupting user access, ensuring a smooth migration process.
    

**Weighted routing policies** offer a powerful mechanism for optimizing traffic distribution, load balancing, and application version testing in Amazon Route 53. By leveraging weights to control traffic flow, you can effectively manage resource utilization, application performance, and user experience.
