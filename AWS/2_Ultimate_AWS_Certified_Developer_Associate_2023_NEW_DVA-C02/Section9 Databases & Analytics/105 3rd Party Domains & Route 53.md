**Domain registrars** and **DNS services** are two distinct but interconnected entities in the realm of domain management. While they both play crucial roles in directing users to websites, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels.

**Domain registrars** are companies authorized to sell domain names to individuals or organizations. They act as intermediaries between the global domain name system (DNS) and the public, registering domain names and maintaining their ownership records. When you purchase a domain name, you become its owner, and the registrar is responsible for maintaining its registration information.

**DNS services**, on the other hand, handle the technical aspects of translating domain names into IP addresses, the unique identifiers for websites on the internet. They operate a network of servers that respond to DNS queries, directing users to the correct IP address for a given domain name.

**Key distinctions between domain registrars and DNS services:**

- **Ownership:** Domain registrars manage the ownership and registration of domain names, while DNS services handle the technical translation of domain names to IP addresses.
    
- **Purpose:** Domain registrars focus on selling and registering domain names, while DNS services focus on providing the technical infrastructure for DNS resolution.
    
- **Integration:** Domain registrars often provide DNS services as part of their offerings, but you can also choose to use a separate DNS provider.
