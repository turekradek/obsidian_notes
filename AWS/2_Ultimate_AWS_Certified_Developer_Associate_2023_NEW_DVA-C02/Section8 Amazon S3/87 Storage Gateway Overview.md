AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid storage service that allows you to bridge your on-premises data and cloud data in AWS. It can be used for disaster recovery, backup and restore, and tiered storage.

There are three types of Storage Gateway:

- **File Gateway:** Connects your on-premises file servers to Amazon S3.
- **Volume Gateway:** Connects your on-premises servers to Amazon EBS.
- **Tape Gateway:** Connects your on-premises tape libraries to Amazon S3 Glacier.

For the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, you need to know that Storage Gateway is a way to bridge your on-premises file systems and storage into the cloud. You do not need to know the details of the different types of Storage Gateway.

**Example use cases for AWS Storage Gateway:**

- **Disaster recovery:** You can use Storage Gateway to create backups of your on-premises data in the cloud. If your on-premises infrastructure fails, you can restore your data from the cloud.
- **Backup and restore:** You can use Storage Gateway to create regular backups of your on-premises data in the cloud. You can also use Storage Gateway to restore your data from the cloud to your on-premises infrastructure.
- **Tiered storage:** You can use Storage Gateway to create a tiered storage system. You can store your frequently accessed data on Amazon EBS or Amazon S3, and you can store your less frequently accessed data on Amazon S3 Glacier.

Overall, AWS Storage Gateway is a powerful tool that can help you to bridge the gap between your on-premises and cloud infrastructure.
