**What is MFA Delete?**

MFA Delete is a security feature in Amazon S3 that requires users to authenticate using a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device before they can permanently delete an object version or suspend versioning on a bucket. This is an extra layer of security that helps to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions.

**How to enable MFA Delete**

MFA Delete can be enabled using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS SDKs. However, the UI of Amazon console does not allow enabling MFA Delete. So, you need to use the AWS CLI to enable MFA Delete.

**How to use MFA Delete**

Once MFA Delete is enabled, users will be prompted to enter their MFA code before they can perform the following actions:

- Permanently deleting an object version
- Suspending versioning on a bucket

**How to disable MFA Delete**

MFA Delete can be disabled using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS SDKs.

**Benefits of using MFA Delete**

MFA Delete can help to prevent the following:

- Accidental deletion of objects
- Unauthorized deletion of objects
- Deletion of objects by malicious actors

**Drawbacks of using MFA Delete**

MFA Delete can make it more difficult to perform destructive actions on S3 buckets. However, this is a trade-off that is worth making for increased security.
