In the next lecture, when doing the hands-on you will realize a new encryption option is available, named DSSE-KMS and [released in June 2023](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-dual-layer-server-side-encryption-with-keys-stored-in-aws-key-management-service-dsse-kms/).

  

**DSSE-KMS is just "double encryption based on KMS".**

  

As long as it is not coming up in the exam, I will not teach it in this course. If you do see it at your exam as an option, please let me know and I will update the course.
