**What are S3 Access Logs?**

S3 Access Logs are a way to track all requests made to your S3 buckets. This includes both authorized and denied requests. The logs are stored in a separate S3 bucket, and you can use them to audit access to your buckets and identify potential security risks.

**How to enable S3 Access Logs**

To enable S3 Access Logs, you must first create a target logging bucket. The target logging bucket must be in the same AWS region as the bucket you are monitoring. Once you have created the target logging bucket, you can enable access logs for your bucket by following these steps:

2. Go to the S3 console and select the bucket you want to monitor.
4. Click on the **Properties** tab.
6. Under **Logging**, click on **Edit**.
8. Select the **Target Bucket** and **Target Prefix**.
10. Click on **Save**.

**What is the S3 Access Logs format?**

The S3 Access Logs format is a JSON-formatted file that contains the following information:

- Bucket owner
- Bucket name
- Request time
- Remote IP address
- Requester
- Request ID
- Operation
- Key
- Request size
- Status code
- Referrer
- User agent
