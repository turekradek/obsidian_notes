**What is MFA Delete?**

MFA Delete is a security feature in Amazon S3 that requires users to authenticate using a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device before they can perform certain destructive actions, such as permanently deleting an object or suspending versioning on a bucket. This is an extra layer of security that helps to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions.

**When is MFA Delete required?**

MFA Delete is required when you perform the following actions:

- Permanently deleting an object version
- Suspending versioning on a bucket

MFA Delete is not required for the following actions:

- Enabling versioning on a bucket
- Listing deleted versions

**How do I enable MFA Delete?**

To enable MFA Delete, you must first enable versioning on the bucket. Then, you can enable MFA Delete for the bucket by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS SDKs.

**What are the benefits of using MFA Delete?**

MFA Delete can help to prevent the following:

- Accidental deletion of objects
- Unauthorized deletion of objects
- Deletion of objects by malicious actors

**What are the drawbacks of using MFA Delete?**

MFA Delete can make it more difficult to perform destructive actions on S3 buckets. However, this is a trade-off that is worth making for increased security.

**Here are some additional notes on MFA Delete:**

- MFA Delete can only be enabled by the bucket owner.
- MFA Delete can be enabled for individual S3 buckets,Â but it cannot be enabled for all buckets in an AWS account.
- MFA Delete is not supported for buckets that store server-side encrypted objects using customer-supplied encryption keys (SSE-C).
