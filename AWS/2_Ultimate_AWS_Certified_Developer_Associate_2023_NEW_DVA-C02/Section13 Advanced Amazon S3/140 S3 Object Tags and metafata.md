**User-Defined Object Metadata and S3 Object Tags**

- User-defined object metadata is a set of key-value pairs that you can attach to your objects when you upload them to Amazon S3. This metadata can be used to provide additional information about the object, such as its origin, creation date, or file type.
    
- S3 object tags are also key-value pairs that you can attach to your objects. However, unlike metadata, tags can be used for fine-grained permissions and analytics. For example, you can use tags to only give access to specific objects with specific tags within AWS, or you can use tags to group your findings by tags when using S3 Analytics.
    
- It is important to note that metadata and tags are not searchable on Amazon S3. You cannot filter by metadata or tags. If you want to search your S3 buckets, you must build an external index in a database, such as DynamoDB.
    
- You can put all of your metadata and tags into a searchable index in DynamoDB and then perform your search on DynamoDB. The results of your search will be extracted as objects on Amazon S3.
