Sure, here is a summary of the lecture on moving objects between different storage classes in AWS:

**Moving Objects Between Different Storage Classes in AWS**

- Objects can be moved between different storage classes in AWS using lifecycle rules.
    
- Lifecycle rules are made up of two parts: transition actions and expiration actions.
    
- Transition actions specify when an object should be moved to a different storage class. For example, you could create a rule to move objects from Standard to Standard IA after 60 days.
    
- Expiration actions specify when an object should be deleted. For example, you could create a rule to delete objects in Glacier Deep Archive after 10 years.
    
- Lifecycle rules can be applied to entire buckets or to specific paths within buckets. They can also be applied to objects with specific tags.
    
- Lifecycle rules can be used to automate the movement of objects between storage classes, which can help to save money on storage costs.
    
- Amazon S3 Analytics can be used to help you determine the optimal number of days to transition an object from one storage class to another.
