**S3 Select and Glacier Select**

- _S3 Select_ enables you to filter data in place in Amazon S3 using SQL-like expressions without having to download the entire object. This can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed, resulting in cost savings and performance improvements.
    
- _Glacier Select_ is a similar feature for Amazon Glacier, which is a low-cost storage service for infrequently accessed data. Glacier Select allows you to filter Glacier data directly without having to restore the entire archive.
    
- Both S3 Select and Glacier Select can be used to filter data based on a variety of criteria, such as file size, date, and content.
    
- Using S3 Select and Glacier Select can help you to reduce your storage costs, improve the performance of your applications, and comply with data privacy regulations.
