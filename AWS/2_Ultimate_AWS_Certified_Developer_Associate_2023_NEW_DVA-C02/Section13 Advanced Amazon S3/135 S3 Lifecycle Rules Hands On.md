Sure, here is a summary of the lecture on creating a lifecycle rule for your buckets in AWS:

**Creating a Lifecycle Rule for Buckets in AWS**

- Lifecycle rules are used to automate the movement of objects between storage classes in AWS.
    
- To create a lifecycle rule, go to the Management tab of your bucket and click on "Create lifecycle rule".
    
- Give your rule a name and select the scope of the rule (all objects in the bucket or objects with specific prefixes or tags).
    
- There are five different rule actions that you can use:
    
    2. Transition current versions of objects between storage classes
    4. Transition non-current versions of objects between storage classes
    6. Expire current versions of objects
    8. Permanently delete non-current versions of objects
    10. Delete expired objects, delete markers, or incomplete multi-part uploads
    
- You can add as many transitions as you want. For example, you could transition an object from Standard to Standard IA after 30 days, then to Intelligent Tier after 60 days, and then to Glacier after 90 days.
    
- You can also set up expiration actions to delete objects after a certain number of days. For example, you could expire current versions of objects after 700 days and permanently delete non-current versions of objects after 700 days.
    
- Once you are happy with your rule, click on "Create role" to activate it. The role will act in the background to move objects between storage classes according to the rules you have defined.
