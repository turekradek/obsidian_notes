## Databricks Data Engineer Professional Exam - Exam Outline: Section 5 - Monitoring & Logging

This section dives into monitoring and logging practices in Databricks, focusing on tools and techniques for performance analysis, debugging, and cost optimization.

**Spark UI for Performance Analysis and Debugging:**

- The Spark UI is a web interface that provides insights into the execution of Spark jobs.
- Key elements include:
    - **Stages:** Represent logical execution units within a job. Analyze execution times, task attempts, and shuffle data volumes.
    - **Jobs:** View overall job execution timelines, including stage completion times and resource utilization.
    - **Tasks:** Examine individual task execution details, identifying failures, bottlenecks, and resource usage (CPU, memory).
    - **Accumulators:** Track custom metrics defined within your Spark code.
    - **Streaming Progress:** Monitor real-time progress and latency in streaming jobs.

**Metrics and Event Timelines:**

- Analyze event timelines for stages and jobs to identify delays, retries, or long-running tasks.
- Correlate metrics from Spark UI with other tools like Ganglia and Cluster UI for a holistic view.

**Troubleshooting Tools and Techniques:**

- **Spark UI:** Identify bottlenecks, inefficient tasks, and excessive shuffle operations.
- **Ganglia UI:** Monitor cluster health, resource utilization (CPU, memory, network), and potential resource contention.
- **Cluster UI:** View historical cluster resource usage and identify potential infrastructure limitations.
- **Driver Logs:** Review logs generated by the Spark driver for detailed error messages and job execution information.
- **Executor Logs:** Analyze logs on worker nodes for task-specific issues and exceptions.

**Monitoring and Cost Optimization for Streaming Jobs:**

- **Metrics and SLAs:** Monitor key metrics like processing time, latency, and throughput to meet Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for cost and latency.
- **Autoscaling:** Leverage autoscaling features to dynamically scale cluster resources based on workload needs, optimizing cost without sacrificing performance.
- **Micro-batching:** Consider micro-batching techniques to break down large data streams into smaller batches for lower latency and resource utilization optimization.

**Deploying and Monitoring Jobs:**

- Utilize Databricks notebooks or jobs API to deploy batch and streaming jobs.
- Configure monitoring dashboards to track key metrics and identify potential issues proactively.
- Use alerts and notifications to be informed of job failures or performance regressions.

**Practice:**

- Set up a Databricks environment and simulate Spark job failures.
- Use the Spark UI and other tools to diagnose the cause of failures.
- Design a streaming job with cost and latency considerations in mind.
