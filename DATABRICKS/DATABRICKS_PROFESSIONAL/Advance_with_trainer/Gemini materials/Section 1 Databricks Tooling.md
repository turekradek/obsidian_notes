## Databricks Data Engineer Professional Exam - Exam Outline: Section 1 - Databricks Tooling

This section focuses on your understanding of Databricks tools and functionalities relevant to data engineering tasks. Here are some materials to help you prepare:

### Delta Lake:

- **Atomicity and Durability:**
    - Databricks utilizes a combination of the **transaction log** and **cloud object storage** to ensure data consistency.
    - The transaction log keeps track of all write operations, allowing rollbacks in case of failures.
    - Cloud object storage (e.g., S3) guarantees data persistence even if Databricks encounters issues.
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC):**
    - Delta Lake implements OCC to handle concurrent write operations.
    - Reads happen at a snapshot point, and writes are validated before committing.
    - Conflicts might arise if two writes attempt to modify the same data concurrently.
    - Databricks handles these conflicts by throwing exceptions, requiring developers to implement retry logic.
- **Delta Clone:**
    - Delta Clone allows creating a point-in-time copy of a Delta table.
    - This copy is lightweight and efficient for tasks like data versioning, rollbacks, or creating development/testing environments.
- **Delta Lake Indexing Optimizations:**
    - **Partitioning:** Divide Delta tables into smaller segments based on specific columns (e.g., date, region).
        - Improves query performance by allowing faster data filtering.
    - **Z-Ordering:** Sort data within partitions by another column used in frequent queries.
        - Further enhances query speed by enabling scans to access relevant data more efficiently.
    - **Bloom filters:** Utilize probabilistic data structures to quickly identify partitions unlikely to contain the desired data.
        - Speeds up queries by eliminating unnecessary partition scans.
    - **File Sizes:** Adjusting file sizes can impact performance.
        - Larger files improve reads but might slow down writes. Consider workload patterns for optimal file size selection.
- **Delta Tables for Databricks SQL:**
    - Optimize Delta tables for Databricks SQL by utilizing:
        - **AUTOOPTIMIZE**: Automatically optimizes partitions and column statistics for improved query performance.
        - **VACUUM**: Reclaims unused storage space after data deletion operations.
